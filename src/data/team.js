[Sasha Prokhorova](https://blog.algolia.com/faces-algolia-meet-sasha-prokhorova/) taught me that design is not just about craft. She made me a better professional along with some others who I consider my mentors like [David la Iglesia](https://dribbble.com/de_la_Iglesia), [Adrian Mato](https://adrianmato.com/) or [Emily Hayman](http://emilyhayman.com/).

[Yesenia](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/) helped me see how design systems can be functional, effective and still convey a brand's personality. The most important lesson, be it design or human level is that communities help us grow and learn from one another. This is why I'm so inspired by people like [Jina](https://www.sushiandrobots.com/), [Mina](http://mina.codes/), [Diana](https://broccolini.net/) or [Stu](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/) who are passionate thought leaders doing so much for the design and development industry.

    questionOne: `I came into design systems very organically. When I began my career in the agency world, I worked within constraints of branding and style guidelines of our various clients. At the time I didn't fully recognize these guidelines as what we now refer to as design systems. As my career continued to grow I noticed that I began to be far more interested in how various companies/brands packaged the many pieces that made up their brand and/or products. I love how design systems bring together all the pieces in order to unleash endless creativity but still maintain the necessary constraints.`,
    questionTwo: `I get a lot of my inspiration from the community I've built via Dribbble. A few of my favorites are the dynamic duo that makes of [TheLittleLabs](https://www.thelittlelabs.com/), Camilo and Aradhana, the illustration work by [Enisaurus](https://www.enisaurus.com/), and [Kendrick Kidd](http://www.kendrickkidd.com/).

    When I first started my career, [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) was a huge inspiration. His book, [The Shape of Design](https://frankchimero.com/design/the-shape-of-design/), really helped to form my philosophy and approach to problems and how to cultivate a design process. Along with that but not design related, [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) has been a great inspiration to how I approach work. His book (written alongside David Heinemeier Hansson) [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) still is the best, no nonsense, business book I've ever read.`,

    questionOne: `I was initially drawn to design systems while working on a small team, where we were stretched thin and struggling to keep the front-end and user experience afloat, recreating components and patterns by hand over and over again. We needed consistency, stability, a bridge between designers and developers, and a more efficient workflow. Once we put a design language and system in place, I was sold on the value. I find it fascinating how many approaches to design systems there are out there, and how different they can be depending on the individual product and teams’ needs.`,
    questionTwo: `[Inge Druckrey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldSkPqZKBl0) and [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) inspired me to get into design, and introduced me to the world of typographic and informational systems (simultaneously). This talk by [Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366) helped me feel less alone when I was starting out in the industry; at a time when code and design weren't yet openly intertwined. I’m also inspired by the folks behind [designbetter.co](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) for making knowledge around design systems transparent and available to everyone.  Additionally, and there are too many people to name, people like [Una Kravetz](https://twitter.com/Una?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), [Tim Holman](https://twitter.com/twholman), and [Val Head](https://twitter.com/vlh) are always on my radar, keeping the internet weird and creative and continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible.`,

    questionOne: `Up until now, I've been mostly working Front End Engineering roles, but I've always been interested in finding something that was a good mix between Front End and Design. Design Systems feels like the perfect hybrid between the two! \n \n I'm also really into accessibility, and I found that having a design system that enforces accessible standards is one of the easiest ways to make progress on getting a team on-boarded with accessibility best practices and getting those practices implemented in production \n \n I'm super excited about our React component library that we've been working on over the past few months!`,
    questionTwo: `Some people & projects that have been inspiring to me are: are Nicole Sullivan, Vaidehi Joshi's [BaseCS blog](https://medium.com/basecs) &
       , Mina Markham's [slay.sh](https://slay.sh/), Una Kravets, Suz Hinton's
       [talk about accessibility at Dinosaur.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKIQkgPVXH4), Marcy Sutton, and Anil Dash.`,

    questionOne: `I worked in data visualization and map-making for most of my career, and solving design problems with data is my jam.

    questionTwo: `Anyone who has ever contributed to [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/) or posted to the [webdesign-l](http://www.webdesign-l.com/) mailing list between 1999 and 2005. The [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/) was hugely inspirational for me, along with web standards pioneers like Eric Meyer, Mark Pilgrim, and Jeff Zeldman. [Jina](https://twitter.com/jina) is one of the hardest-working people in design systems, and her leadership in the community is a tremendous inspiration. I learned everything I know about SVG from [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan), and everything I could _hope_ to know about CSS Grid from [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) and [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons).

    questionTwo: `I don't have room on this webpage to list everyone!
