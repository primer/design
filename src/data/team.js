[Sasha Prokhorova](https://blog.algolia.com/faces-algolia-meet-sasha-prokhorova/) taught me that design is not just about craft.

[Yesenia](https://www.yeseniaperezcruz.com/) helped me see how design systems can be functional, effective and still convey a brand's personality. The most important lesson, be it design or human level is that communities help us grow and learn from one another.

    Design Systems seemed to blend all aspects of my interests: Product Design, Front-End Development, Graphic Design, Typography, Illustration, etc. I’m drawn to design systems as it’s a field that welcomes individuals who have too many interests to count, and find themselves at intersections of many different passions. `,
    questionTwo: `I draw in a lot of inspiration from so many different facets of my life. I’m really fortunate to come from a diverse set of backgrounds to be able to see parallels that emerge from a variety of industries.

    The field of Graphic Design has a tremendous influence on me, and some of the designers and studios I’m inspired by are: [Natasha Jen](https://www.pentagram.com/about/natasha-jen), [Barron Webster](https://barronwebster.com/), [Maxime Buschi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBifN7qBgw), [Michael Bierut](https://www.pentagram.com/about/michael-bierut), [Eric Hu](http://erichu.info/), [Micah Barrett](http://micahbarrett.design/), [Draw Down Books](https://draw-down.com/), [Wei Huang](https://twitter.com/w__h_?lang=en), [Josh Schaub](http://joshschaub.ch/), [Morcoskey](https://morcoskey.com/), and [David Rudnik](https://davidrudnick.org/). I’ve always been inspired by those who are experimenting at the intersection of design and technology: [Tristan Harris](http://www.tristanharris.com/), [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/), [Studio No-Plans](https://no-plans.com/), [Marie Otsuka](http://motsuka.com/), [Ben Wilkins](https://twitter.com/thatbenlifetho?lang=en), [Jon Gold](https://jon.gold/), [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/),  and [Chris Novello](http://chrisnovello.com/). I also love typography, and have a lot of admiration for type-designers and foundries: [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/), [Kris Sowersby (Klim Type)](https://klim.co.nz/), [Matthew Carter](https://www.myfonts.com/person/Matthew_Carter/), [Richard Lipton](https://lipton.typenetwork.com/), [Lucas Sharp](http://lucassharp.com/), [Grilli Type](https://www.grillitype.com/), and [James Edmondson (OHnotypeco)](https://ohnotype.co/). There’s so many more people that I’ve learned and drawn inspiration from to mention and praise, so feel free to reach out! I’d love to share and discuss. <3`,

    questionOne: `I came into design systems very organically. When I began my career in the agency world, I worked within constraints of branding and style guidelines of our various clients. At the time I didn't fully recognize these guidelines as what we now refer to as design systems. As my career continued to grow I noticed that I began to be far more interested in how various companies/brands packaged the many pieces that made up their brand and/or products. I love how design systems bring together all the pieces in order to unleash endless creativity but still maintain the necessary constraints.`,
    questionTwo: `I get a lot of my inspiration from the community I've built via Dribbble. A few of my favorites are the dynamic duo that makes of [TheLittleLabs](https://www.thelittlelabs.com/), Camilo and Aradhana, the illustration work by [Enisaurus](https://www.enisaurus.com/), and [Kendrick Kidd](http://www.kendrickkidd.com/).

    When I first started my career, [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) was a huge inspiration. His book, [The Shape of Design](https://frankchimero.com/design/the-shape-of-design/), really helped to form my philosophy and approach to problems and how to cultivate a design process. Along with that but not design related, [Jason Fried](https://twitter.com/jasonfried) has been a great inspiration to how I approach work. His book (written alongside David Heinemeier Hansson) [Rework](https://basecamp.com/books/rework) still is the best, no nonsense, business book I've ever read.`,

    questionOne: `I was initially drawn to design systems while working on a small team, where we were stretched thin and struggling to keep the front-end and user experience afloat, recreating components and patterns by hand over and over again. We needed consistency, stability, a bridge between designers and developers, and a more efficient workflow. Once we put a design language and system in place, I was sold on the value. I find it fascinating how many approaches to design systems there are out there, and how different they can be depending on the individual product and teams’ needs.`,
    questionTwo: `[Inge Druckrey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldSkPqZKBl0) and [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_ei) inspired me to get into design, and introduced me to the world of typographic and informational systems (simultaneously). This talk by [Bret Victor](https://vimeo.com/36579366) helped me feel less alone when I was starting out in the industry; at a time when code and design weren't yet openly intertwined. I’m also inspired by the folks behind [designbetter.co](https://www.designbetter.co/design-systems-handbook) for making knowledge around design systems transparent and available to everyone.  Additionally, and there are too many people to name, people like [Una Kravetz](https://twitter.com/Una?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), [Tim Holman](https://twitter.com/twholman), and [Val Head](https://twitter.com/vlh) are always on my radar, keeping the internet weird and creative and continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible.`,

    questionOne: `Up until now, I've been mostly working Front End Engineering roles, but I've always been interested in finding something that was a good mix between Front End and Design. Design Systems feels like the perfect hybrid between the two! \n \n I'm also really into accessibility, and I found that having a design system that enforces accessible standards is one of the easiest ways to make progress on getting a team on-boarded with accessibility best practices and getting those practices implemented in production \n \n I'm super excited about our React component library that we've been working on over the past few months!`,
    questionTwo: `Some people & projects that have been inspiring to me are: are Nicole Sullivan, Vaidehi Joshi's [BaseCS blog](https://medium.com/basecs) &

[Jina](https://twitter.com/jina) is one of the hardest-working people in design systems, and her leadership in the community is a tremendous inspiration. I learned everything I know about SVG from [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan), and everything I could _hope_ to know about CSS Grid from [Rachel Andrew](https://twitter.com/rachelandrew) and [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons).

    questionTwo: `I don't have room on this webpage to list everyone!
