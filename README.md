# Primer Interface Guidelines

Documentation for UI patterns and interaction guidelines.

## Status

This is currently a work in progress! Follow along on our [project board](https://github.com/primer/design/projects/1).

## Local development

1. Clone this repo, e.g. with:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/primer/design
   ```

2. In the terminal, navigate (`cd`) to the repo directory
3. `nvm use --default` to use the correct node version.
4. `yarn` to install dependencies
5. `yarn start` to start the dev server

## Deployment

We deploy this site using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Every push to a branch other than `main` will deploy to a URL unique to the preview environment. Merges to `main` will automatically deploy the site to `https://primer.github.io/design/`.
