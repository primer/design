# Contributing to Primer Interface Guidelines

You can read about different ways to contribute to the Primer Design System in [primer.style/contribute](https://primer.style/contribute/how-to-contribute).

If you are designing new components, please read the [design contribution guidelines](https://primer.style/contribute/design).

If you are writing documentation, please read the [documentation guidelines](https://primer.style/contribute/documentation).

## Design guidelines template
Even though some guidelines follow a different format, most can use the following template as a starting point. Required sections are indicated.

ðŸ’¡ The [action list component](https://primer.style/components/action-list) documentation is a good example of design guidelines.

| Section                  | Description                                                                        | Notes                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name / Title (required)         | Name of the component                                                                                                        | Use the singular form. Keep it as short as possible. Use sentence case ("Select menu", and not "SelectMenu").                                                                                                   |
| Description (required)  | In a sentence, what is this component used for.                      | It should allow the reader to decide if they should continue reading or move on. Avoid going into specific usage and implementation detail. Donâ€™t include guidelines. Donâ€™t repeat words from the title to describe the content. |
| Anatomy (required)       | A labelled image of the most representative view(s) of the component, followed by a glossary of the constituent parts.                                                               | What smaller components constitute the larger pattern.                  |
| Usage (required)         | List of dos and donts covering the most important ways of how to (and not) use the component. This section can also be referred to as **Options**.        | Consider when and how this component could be used incorrectly, what are the ideal ways of using it, special cases, alternative components (include links if needed).                                        |
| Hierarchy and placement            | Where to use the component and how it interacts with the rest of the UI.                                                                              | Include images and dos and donts of how the component should be used within the UI.         |
| Accessibility            | Accessibility considerations when using the component.                                                                              | Include keyboard navigation, descriptions, common mistakes to avoid.         |
