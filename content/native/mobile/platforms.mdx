title: Platforms
description: GitHub builds mobile apps for iOS, iPad, and Android devices. All the applications are built natively, using modern languages like Kotlin and Swift. Our goal is to provide an experience that respects people's decisions to use different operating systems.

<ScrollToAnchor />

We try to design apps that feel at home on their respective platform, taking advantage of the unique functionality that exists within each ecosystem. At the same time, we lean on GitHub's design language of colors, iconography, copywriting, and visual design, to provide a coherent cross-platform experience to people.

## GitHub

While we do our best to leverage platform technologies on Android and iOS, we also use components, colors, iconography, and other elements from GitHub's design infrastructure to provide understandable and cohesive experiences across all platforms.

## Responsive web

The mobile apps complement GitHub's responsive web efforts. The web – and the value of the URL – remain a core part of GitHub's product philosophy. Because of this, we do our best to provide escape hatches from the apps to the mobile website whenever possible. We do this by including Share actions in the navigation bar whenever possible.

Conversely, many experiences can be better when we remove the URL and allow users to take advantage of a more gesture-based, fluid app experience. For example, when triaging notifications, it can often feel faster and easier to swipe notifications done, rather than tapping through them one at a time. Because these experiences can be so powerful, we also provide prompts in the mobile browser to open GitHub's native app.
