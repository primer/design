title: useOnEscapePress
---

`useOnEscapePress` is a simple utility Hook that calls a user-provided function when the `Escape` key is pressed. The hook sets up `keydown` event listener on `window.document` and executes the user-provided function if these conditions are met:

1. The Escape key was pressed
2. The `preventDefault` method has not yet been called on the event object.

Furthermore, unlike the normal behavior for multiple event listeners existing on the same DOM Node, if multiple `useOnEscapePress` hooks are active simultaneously, the callbacks will occur in reverse order. In other words, if a parent component and a child component both call `useOnEscapePress`, when the user presses Escape, the child component's callback will execute, followed by the parent's callback. Each callback has the chance to call `.preventDefault()` on the event to prevent further callbacks.

### Dependencies

Similar to `useCallback`, `useOnEscapePress` takes a `React.DependencyList` as its second argument. These are the dependencies used to memoize the callback. Failing to provide the correct dependency list can result in degraded performance. If this argument is omitted, we will assume that the callback is already memoized. In the example below, that memoization occurs in `DemoComponent` with a call to `React.useCallback`, so `OverlayDemo` does not need to pass a dependency list.

### Usage

```javascript live noinline
const OverlayDemo = ({onEscape, children}) => {
  useOnEscapePress(onEscape)
  return <Box height="200px">{children}</Box>
}

function DemoComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const toggleOverlay = React.useCallback(() => {
    setIsOpen(isOpen => !isOpen)
  }, [])
  const closeOverlay = React.useCallback(() => {
    setIsOpen(false)
  }, [])
  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={toggleOverlay}>toggle</Button>
      {isOpen && (
        <OverlayDemo onEscape={closeOverlay}>
          <Button>Button One</Button>
          <Button>Button Two</Button>
        </OverlayDemo>
      )}
    </>
  )
}

render(<DemoComponent />)
```
