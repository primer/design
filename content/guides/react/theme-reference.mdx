title: Theme Reference
description: The default theme object for Primer React components

import {theme} from '@primer/react'
import ThemeReferenceTree from '~/src/components/theme-reference-tree'

Colors in this theme object reference CSS variables from Primer Primitives under the hood with a raw value as a fallback. We recommend [using CSS variables directly](primer/design/content/foundations/primitives/migrating.mdx) instead.

<ThemeReferenceTree themeData={theme} />

<Note>

See [Theming](/guides/react/theming) to learn how theming works in Primer React.
