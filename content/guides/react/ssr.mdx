## SSR-safe ID generation

Some Primer components generate their own DOM IDs. Those IDs must be isomorphic (so that server-side rendering and client-side rendering yield the same ID, avoiding hydration issues) and unique across the DOM. We use [@react-aria/ssr](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/ssr.html) to generate those IDs. In client-only rendering, this doesn't require any additional work. In SSR contexts, you must wrap your application with at least one `SSRProvider`:

```jsx
import {SSRProvider} from '@primer/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <SSRProvider>
      <MyApplication />
    </SSRProvider>
  )
}
```

`SSRProvider` maintains the context necessary to ensure IDs are consistent. In cases where some parts of the react tree are rendered asynchronously, you should wrap an additional `SSRProvider` around the conditionally rendered elements:

```jsx
function MyApplication() {
  const [dataA] = useAsyncData('a');
  const [dataB] = useAsyncData('b');

  return (
    <>
      <SSRProvider>
        {dataA && <MyComponentA data={dataA} />}
      </SSRProvider>
      <SSRProvider>
        {dataB && <MyComponentB data={dataB} />}
      </SSRProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```

This will ensure that the IDs are consistent for any sequencing of `dataA` and `dataB` being resolved.
