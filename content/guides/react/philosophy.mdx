title: Primer React Philosophy

## Presentational Components

We are focusing primarily on presentational components that help standardize common design patterns. Primer React components don't handle fetching and submitting data to/from APIs. If you would like to handle data in a Primer Component, feel free to create a wrapper around the Primer Component to do so.

## Pattern Components vs Helper Components

Our components can roughly be categorized into two different component types:

### Pattern Components

Pattern components help us repeat commonly used UI patterns and interactions in order to maintain our brand and provide a great user experience. Some examples of pattern components are `Button`, `Avatar`, or `Label`.

### Helper Components

Helper components are components that help the user achieve common CSS patterns while maintaining some control over values used. An example of a helper component is `Box`.

## A note on flexibility

**Assume that people will break the rules, provide safe ways for them to do so.**

While we aim to standardize design in Primer React, we also provide additional styling flexibility through the [`sx` prop](/guides/react/overriding-styles). This enables small customizations to color and spacing, using values from the theme. Users also have the option to override the theme with a theme of their own.
