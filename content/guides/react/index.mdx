## Dotcom Codespaces (staff-only)

Are you a GitHub employee (Hubber) looking to make a change to primer/react or another Primer library? Take a look at our documentation for the [`primerize` tool](https://github.com/github/primer-engineering/blob/main/how-we-work/developing-in-dotcom-codespaces.md) (GitHub staff only), which can help get you started in a dotcom codespace.

## Getting started

1. Install `@primer/react` and its peer dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @primer/react react react-dom styled-components
   ```

2. Wrap the root of your application with `ThemeProvider` and `BaseStyles`:

   ```jsx
   import {ThemeProvider, BaseStyles} from '@primer/react'

   function App() {
     return (
       <ThemeProvider>
         <BaseStyles>
           <div>...</div>
         </BaseStyles>
       </ThemeProvider>
     )
   }
   ```

3. Import components from `@primer/react` and use them in your application:

   ```jsx
   import {Button} from '@primer/react'

   function MyComponent() {
     return <Button>Click me</Button>
   }
   ```

### Polyfills & Browser Support

Primer React supports the current versions of [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/), and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge), as well as the [Firefox Extended Support Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/). This is consistent with [GitHub's Browser Support](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/supported-browsers).

Primer React does not transform code to support older ECMAScript versions (eg. ES5), and uses ECMAScript features like `Object.assign` and syntax features like native classes and Object destructuring and spreading.

Any environment that uses Primer React should have all the necessary polyfills installed to comply with the latest code standards, as Primer React does not ship with them. Additionally, as Primer React does not transform code to support older versions, it may be necessary for projects to transform the code if support for older browsers (such as Edge 18) is needed.

### Minimizing bundle size

Module bundlers that use ECMAScript modules (ESM) will automatically tree-shake Primer React, ensuring that no unused code is included in your final bundle. However, if you're not using ESM, you may be able to drastically reduce the size of your final bundle by importing components individually from the `lib` subfolder:

```javascript
// using import syntax
import Box from '@primer/react/lib/Box'
```

```javascript
// using require syntax
const Box = require('@primer/react/lib/Box')
```

Note that the modules in the `lib` folder are CommonJS-style modules; if you're using ESM and a compatible module bundler, importing files individually from `lib` provides no benefit.

### Peer dependencies

Primer React ships with a few libraries labeled as peer dependencies. These libraries are commonly already installed in host projects and installing multiple versions can introduce errors.

Primer React requires the following peer dependencies:

- `styled-components` at version 4.0.0 or higher
- `react` at versions 17.x or higher
- `react-dom` at versions 17.x or higher

## BaseStyles

In order to set baseline color, font-family, and line-heights across your project, you will need to establish base Primer styles for your app by wrapping all of your Primer components in `<BaseStyles>` at the root of your app:

```jsx
import {BaseStyles, Box, Heading} from '@primer/react'

export default () => (
  <BaseStyles>
    <Box m={4}>
      <Heading as="h2" sx={{mb: 2}}>
        Hello, world!
      </Heading>
      <p>This will get Primer text styles.</p>
    </Box>
  </BaseStyles>
)
```

This will apply the same `color`, `font-family`, and `line-height` styles to the `<body>` as [Primer CSS's base styles](https://github.com/primer/css/blob/main/src/base/base.scss#L15-L20).

## Static CSS rendering

If you're rendering React components both server- and client-side, we suggest following [styled-component's server-side rendering instructions](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#server-side-rendering) to avoid the flash of unstyled content for server-rendered components.

## TypeScript

Primer React includes TypeScript support and ships with its own typings. You will still need to install type definitions for peer dependencies if you import them in your own application code.

Once installed, you can import components and their prop type interfaces from the `@primer/react` package:

```typescript
import {Button, ButtonProps} from '@primer/react'
```

### Fixing "Duplicate identifier 'FormData'"

In versions `4.1.19` and later, `@types/styled-components` declares a dependency on both `@types/react` and `@types/react-native`. Unfortunately, those declarations clash; for more information, see [issue 33311](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33311) and [issue 33015](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33015) in the DefinitelyTyped repo.

You may run into this conflict even if you're not importing anything from `react-native` or don't have it installed. This is because some package managers hoist packages to the top-level `node_modules` folder, and the TypeScript compiler automatically includes types from all folders in `node_modules/@types` by default.

The TypeScript compiler allows you to opt-out of this behavior [using the `typeRoots` and `types` configuration options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#types-typeroots-and-types). The best solution for this error, at least for now, seems to be to opt out of the automatic inclusion of `node_modules/@types` and instead list the types you want to be included individually.

In your `tsconfig.json`, add to the `types` array under the `compilerOptions` like so:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["node", "react", "styled-components", "jest"]
  }
}
```

You'll need to customize the array based on the `@types/` packages you have installed for your project.

## Silencing warnings

Like React, Primer React emits warnings to the JavaScript console under certain conditions, eg. when using deprecated components or props. Similar to React, you can silence these warnings by setting the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `production` during bundling.

## Testing

Testing your application with Primer React is no different than testing your application with any other React library. Depending on your test environment and the testing libraries you use, you may need polyfills. For example, `jest` runs via Node runtime and uses [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) as a DOM implementation, meaning you will need to mock some browser APIs. We have [helpers](https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/src/utils/test-helpers.tsx) that can be used to mock some of these APIs. You can import the helpers in your test setup file like so:

```js
import '@primer/react/lib-esm/utils/test-helpers' // For ESM
import '@primer/react/lib/utils/test-helpers' // For CommonJS
```

## More information

See the [primer/react repository](https://github.com/primer/react/tree/main/docs/content) for more information about how to use and contribute to Primer React. For component-specific documentation, check out the React section in the component's docs (example: [ActionList](/components/action-list/react)).
