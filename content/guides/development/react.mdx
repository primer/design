## Getting started

1. Install `@primer/react` and its peer dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install @primer/react react react-dom styled-components
   ```

2. Wrap the root of your application with `ThemeProvider` and `BaseStyles`:

   ```jsx
   import {ThemeProvider, BaseStyles} from '@primer/react'

   function App() {
     return (
       <ThemeProvider>
         <BaseStyles>
           <div>...</div>
         </BaseStyles>
       </ThemeProvider>
     )
   }
   ```

3. Import components from `@primer/react` and use them in your application:

   ```jsx
   import {Button} from '@primer/react'

   function MyComponent() {
     return <Button>Click me</Button>
   }
   ```

## More information
