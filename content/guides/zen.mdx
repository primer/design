title: The Zen of GitHub

> “Whether you call it taste, culture, or zen, there are underlying assumptions that members of an organization rely on to resolve ambiguity in pursuit of the organization’s mission.”

The [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/zen) consolidates the Zen of GitHub in its own codebase, in 14 aphorisms:

- Responsive is better than fast
- It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
- Anything added dilutes everything else
- Practicality beats purity
- Approachable is better than simple
- Mind your words, they are important
- Speak like a human
- Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
- Encourage flow
- Non-blocking is better than blocking
- Favor focus over features
- Avoid administrative distraction
- Design for failure
- Keep it logically awesome
