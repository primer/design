## How can you contribute

Currently only **GitHub employees** can contribute to **Primer Web**, due to how Figma handles open source files. 
To make changes you first need to [create a branch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNCGEC2G1E) from Primer Web and name it `@username/changes-being-made`. 
For example: `@lukasoppermann/update-button-radius`.

When you are satisfied with the changes you made, request a review from the [direct responsible individual](https://github.com/primer/figma/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md#contribute-new-components-or-updates) (DRI) of the file. If you are not sure who that is, reach out in the #primer-figma slack channel.

Once your branch is approved, a maintainer will take care of merging and publishing the changes to the library.

We use this process to make sure no accidental changes get added to the library. It also allows us to better track changes added by a branch. Think of it as a repo that does not allow direct pushes to the main branch.

## Authoring components in Figma

### Naming

The name of a component and it's properties should reflected what is present in code whenever possible.

For example, the button component would be named `Button` instead of `btn` which is neither a utility or component name but a prior reference from CSS.

Component names use [PascalCase](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/programming-naming-conventions-explained#:~:text=PascalCase%20is%20a%20variable%20naming,%3A%20FirstName%2C%20TotalBalance%2C%20WigsWorn.). For example, the action list component is named `ActionList`. Refer to the ["Spelling of component names" ADR](https://github.com/github/primer/blob/main/adrs/2022-02-15-spelling-of-component-names.md) for more context.

### Layer structure

Every component that is added should have its layers named to reflect what is rendered on that layer. When describing component layer structure, Primer uses a left-to-right direction to reflect start-to-end positioning.

When updating existing components, be careful with adding or removing layers that have children as this will create a breaking change for consumners.
