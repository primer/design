## How can you contribute

Currently only **GitHub employees** can contribute to **Primer Web**, due to how Figma handles open source files. 
To make changes you first need to [create a branch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbNCGEC2G1E) from Primer Web and name it `@username/changes-being-made`. 
For example: `@lukasoppermann/update-button-radius`.

When you are satisfied with the changes you made, request a review from the [direct responsible individual](https://github.com/primer/figma/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md#contribute-new-components-or-updates) (DRI) of the file. If you are not sure who that is, reach out in the #primer-figma slack channel.

Once your branch is approved, a maintainer will take care of merging and publishing the changes to the library.

We use this process to make sure no accidental changes get added to the library. It also allows us to better track changes added by a branch. Think of it as a repo that does not allow direct pushes to the main branch.
