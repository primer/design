title: Assistive technology announcements
---

## Overview

These guidelines will help you determine when assistive tools should output a message.

## Guidelines

- **Always: Announce location changes** — Help users understand where they are on a page. Maintain positional awareness.
- **Always: Announce results of user actions** — Give feedback about the success or failure directly following a user action.
- **Sometimes: Announce other changes** — Explore case-by-case when changes are disconnected from the user’s place and the success or failure of the user’s actions. For example:
  - Distracting change announcements: When other users add issue comments; when presence indicators appear
  - Essential change announcements: When log lines stream in on the GitHub Actions workflow run page
