## Overview

Headings play a critical role in communicating the structure of a page. Heading levels range from `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

### Best practices

- Avoid skipping heading levels. `<h1>` should be followed by `<h2>` and so on.
- Do not use heading elements solely for resizing text.
- Avoid setting more than one `<h1>` per page. `<h1>` should be reserved to describe the page as a whole, similar to a page `<title>`. (Dialog headings are excepted from this rule.)

## Why?

A correct heading structure is critical for enabling users to navigate quickly within a page. Headings are by far the most common navigation technique for screen reader users.
[67.7% of surveyed screen reader users](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#finding) responded that they are first likely to navigate via the headings when trying
to find information on a lengthy web page. A proper heading structure also allows sighted users to visually scan and find what they want on a page quickly.

An improper heading structure can cause a confusing navigation experience.

## Guidelines

### For designers

In your designs, annotate the heading level. Properly labeled headings are one of the most important things a designer can do for developer handoff.

### For engineers

As you're developing a page, use tools like [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview/) and [HeadingsMap](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/headingsmap/flbjommegcjonpdmenkdiocclhjacmbi/related?hl=en)
to verify the heading structure. You may also inspect the DOM structure of your page using the browser inspector, but using an extension will surface heading levels more easily.
