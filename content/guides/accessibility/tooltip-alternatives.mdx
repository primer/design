## Overview

Tooltips are often used to convey information. However, tooltips are rarely appropriate, and their misuse can result in a myriad of accessibility issues.
Always consider **not** using a tooltip for an improved user experience.

## Why?

- Tooltips are hidden by default making it easy to miss, so they should never be used to convey critical information.
- Tooltips are never accessible on mobile devices.
- Tooltips should **never** be set on non-interactive elements (for example, `div`, `span`, `p`), and should only ever be set on interactive elements (for example, `button`, `a`). Tooltips on non-interactive elements are not accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

## Guidelines

### For designers

- Reserve tooltips for components like icon buttons.
- Keep your tooltip text minimal.
- Only include tooltips on other components as a last resort.
- **Never** include tooltips on non-interactive components (`div`, `span`, `p`).

    <h4>Annotations</h4>If you have an appropriate tooltip in your design, annotate the tooltip carefully with the
    preferred type (whether it's a label or description) to ensure proper semantics.

</Box>

### For developers

If you come across a design or a page with a tooltip on a static element (for example, `div`, `span`, `p`), remove it. Consult a designer for an alternative way of conveying the information.

If you determine that tooltips are appropriate for your use case, make sure to carefully follow guidelines set in [Primer ViewComponents: Tooltip component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/tooltip).

## Alternatives to tooltips

See [Tooltip interface guidelines](../../components/tooltip.mdx) for example alternatives to using tooltips.
