description: Type utilities are designed to work in combination with line-height utilities so as to result in more sensible numbers wherever possible.

Font sizes are smaller on mobile and scale up at the `md` [breakpoint](/foundations/css-utilities/grid#breakpoints) to be larger on desktop.

| Scale | Font size: mobile | Font size: desktop | 1.25 line height | 1.5 line height |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- |
| 00    | 40px              | 48px               | 60               | 72              |
| 0     | 32px              | 40px               | 50               | 60              |
| 1     | 26px              | 32px               | 40               | 48              |
| 2     | 22px              | 24px               | 30               | 36              |
| 3     | 18px              | 20px               | 25               | 30              |
| 4     | 16px              | 16px               | 20               | 24              |
| 5     | 14px              | 14px               | 17.5             | 21              |
| 6     | 12px              | 12px               | 15               | 18              |

## Heading utilities

Use `.h1` – `.h6` to change an elements font size and weight to match our heading styles.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--heading'}]} height="260" />

These are particularly useful for changing the visual appearance while keeping the markup semantically correct. Be sure you keep the hierarchy appropriate for the page.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--heading-semantic'}]} height="100" />

## Type scale utilities

Use `.f1` – `.f6` to change an elements font size while keeping inline with our type scale.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--font-size'}]} height="280" />

Lighter font-weight utilities are available in a limited range: `.f00-light` - `.f3-light`. Lighter font-weights reduce the legibility of text, particularly at small font sizes, so the scale only goes down to `f3` at 20px. The larger sizes`f0` and `f00` allow for lighter and larger type that is in keeping with our marketing styles.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--font-size-light'}]} height="280" />

## Line height styles

Change the line height density with these utilities: `.lh-default`, `.lh-condensed`, `.lh-condensed-ultra`. Responsive variants are also available (e.g. `.lh-sm-condensed`).

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--line-height'}]} height="280" />

The `lh-0` utility class sets `line-height: 0 !important`, and can be used to remove vertical spacing from elements that inherit line-height but don't contain any text.

## Typographic styles

Change the font weight, styles, and alignment with these utilities.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--typographic-styles'}]} height="600" />

## Word-break

There are two utilities for adjusting how lines and words of text break when they exceed the width of their containing element:

1. `wb-break-word` sets `word-break: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word`, which will only break words if they would exceed the line length _after wrapping_.

2. `wb-break-all` sets `word-break: break-all`, which will force a word to break regardless of whether it's shorter than the line length. See [MDN's `word-break` docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/word-break#Values) for more info.

## Text alignment

Use text alignment utilities `.text-left`, `.text-center`, and `.text-right` to left align, center, or right align text.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--text-alignment'}]} height="150" />

## Responsive text alignment

Use the following formula to make a text alignment utility responsive: `.text-[breakpoint]-[alignment]`.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--text-alignment-responsive'}]} height="100" />

## List styles

Remove bullets from an unordered list or numbers from an ordered list by applying `.list-style-none` to the `<ul>`.

<StorybookEmbed framework="css" stories={[{id: 'utilities-typography--list'}]} height="100" />
