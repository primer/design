## Fullscreen click area

Use `.details-overlay` to expand the click area of `<summary>` to cover the full screen, so user can click anywhere on a page to close `<details>`.

## Darkened fullscreen click area

Use `.details-overlay-dark` darken the click area overlay. Useful for modals.

## Custom caret

Use `.details-reset` to remove the default caret (that little triangle on the left). You then can add the `.dropdown-caret` on the right of the text.

## Using button styles with the details summary element

You can add `.btn` and `.btn-*` classes to any
[`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)
element so that it gains the appearance of a button, and
selected/active styles when the parent
[`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
element is open.
