Animation | Description
--- | ---
Fade in | The `.anim-fade-in` class is used to fade in an element on the page. This will run once when the element is revealed.
Fade out | The `.anim-fade-out` class is used to fade out an element on the page. This will run once when the element is revealed.
Fade up | The `.anim-fade-up` class is used to reveal an element on the page by sliding it up from below the fold. You should use this in a container with `overflow: hidden;` or on the bottom of the page.
Fade down | The `.anim-fade-down` class is used to slide an element down hiding it. You should use this in a container with `overflow: hidden;` or on the bottom of the page.
Scale in | The `.anim-scale-in` class will scale the element in. This is useful on menus when you want them to appear more friendly.
Grow x | The `.anim-grow-x` class will grow an element width from 0-:100: real quick.
Pulse | The `.anim-pulse` class will pulse an element infinitely.
Hover animation | The `.anim-hover-grow` class will increase the scale of the element upon hover.
Rotation | The `.anim-rotate` class will rotate the element indefinitely around the coordinate specified by `transform-origin`. Most elements have a default of `transform-origin: 50% 50%` and will rotate around the center.
