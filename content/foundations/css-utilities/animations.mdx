| Animation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Fade in   | The `.anim-fade-in` class is used to fade in an element on the page. This will run once when the element is revealed.                                                                                               |
| Fade out  | The `.anim-fade-out` class is used to fade out an element on the page. This will run once when the element is revealed.                                                                                             |
| Fade up   | The `.anim-fade-up` class is used to reveal an element on the page by sliding it up from below the fold. You should use this in a container with `overflow: hidden;` or on the bottom of the page.                  |
| Fade down | The `.anim-fade-down` class is used to slide an element down hiding it. You should use this in a container with `overflow: hidden;` or on the bottom of the page.                                                   |
| Scale in  | The `.anim-scale-in` class will scale the element in. This is useful on menus when you want them to appear more friendly.                                                                                           |
| Grow x    | The `.anim-grow-x` class will grow an element width from 0-:100: real quick.                                                                                                                                        |
| Pulse     | The `.anim-pulse` class will pulse an element infinitely.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Hover     | The `.anim-hover-grow` class will increase the scale of the element upon hover.                                                                                                                                     |
| Rotate    | The `.anim-rotate` class will rotate the element indefinitely around the coordinate specified by `transform-origin`. Most elements have a default of `transform-origin: 50% 50%` and will rotate around the center. |
