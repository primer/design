title: Margin
description: Margin utilities are based on a global spacing scale which helps keep horizontal and vertical spacing consistent. These utilities help us reduce the amount of custom CSS that share the same properties, and allows to achieve many different page layouts using the same styles.

## Naming convention

Since margin utilities have many variations and will be used in many places, we use a shorthand naming convention to help keep class names succinct.


| Shorthand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| m   | margin |
| t   | top |
| r   | right |
| b   | bottom |
| l   | left |
| x   | horizontal, left & right |
| y   | vertical, top & bottom |
| 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 4px   |
| 2   | 8px   |
| 3   | 16px  |
| 4   | 24px  |
| 5   | 32px  |
| 6   | 40px  |
| 7   | 48px  |
| 8   | 64px  |

| 10  | 96px  |
| 11  | 112px |

## Uniform margins

Use uniform spacing utilities to apply equal margin to all sides of an element. These utilities can change or override default margins, and can be used with a spacing scale from 0-6.

  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'uniform': {name: 'uniform'}}}
  height="150"
/>

## Directional margins

Use directional utilities to apply margin to an individual side, or the X and Y axis of an element. Directional utilities can change or override default margins, and can be used with a spacing scale of 0-6.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'directional': {name: 'directional'}}}
  height="100"
/>

## Extended vertical margins

The extended scale starts from spacer `7` up to `12`. **Note**: Only the y-axis (`mt`, `mb` and `my`) and its responsive variants are supported.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'directional-extended': {name: 'directional-extended'}}}
  height="200"
/>

## Center elements

Use `mx-auto`to center block elements with a set width.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'auto': {name: 'auto'}}}
  height="100"
/>

We also provide directional margin auto. `mt-auto, mr-auto, mb-auto, ml-auto`

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'auto-directional': {name: 'auto-directional'}}}
  height="250"
/>

## Reset margins
Reset margins built into typography elements or other components with `m-0`, `mt-0`, `mr-0`, `mb-0`, `ml-0`, `mx-0`, and `my-0`.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'reset': {name: 'reset'}}}
  height="100"
/>

## Responsive margins

All margin utilities can be adjusted per [breakpoint](/foundations/css-utilities/grid#breakpoints) using the following formula: `m[direction]-[breakpoint]-[spacer]`. Each responsive style is applied to the specified breakpoint and up.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'responsive': {name: 'responsive'}}}
  height="100"
/>

## Negative margins

You can add negative margins to the top, right, bottom, or left of an item by adding a negative margin utility. The formula for this is: `m[direction]-n[spacer]`, where `spacer` runs from `1` to `6`. This also works responsively, with the following formula: `m[direction]-[breakpoint]-n[spacer]`.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'negative': {name: 'negative'}}}
  height="100"
/>

## Extended negative margins

You can use the extended spacing scale for `top` and `bottom` margins, ranging from `1` to `12`.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-margin"
  stories={{'negative-extended': {name: 'negative-extended'}}}
  height="150"
