description: Box shadows are used to make content appear elevated. They are typically applied to containers of content that users need to pay attention to or content that appears on top of (overlapping) other elements on the page (like a pop-over or modal).

## Small

Small shadows are mainly used on things that need to appear slightly elevated, like pricing cards or UI elements containing important information.

These types of shadows are typically applied to elements with borders, such as the [Box component](/components/box).

## Medium

Medium box shadows are more diffused and slightly larger than small box shadows.

Medium box shadows are typically used on editorialized content that needs to appear elevated. Most of the time, the elements using this level of shadow will be clickable.

## Large

Large box shadows are very diffused and used sparingly in the product UI.
