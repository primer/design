<Note>
  Please note Primer CSS v18 has changed the naming of these color classes. Check the <a href="/css/support/v18-migration">migration guide</a> to make sure your app is up to date.
</Note>

These utilities should only be used where color is not provided by a component. To learn more about how to apply color, read the [color documentation](/foundations/color).

## Text

Use text color utilities to set text to a specific color. Color contrast must pass a minimum WCAG accessibility rating of [level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). This ensures that viewers who cannot see the full color spectrum are able to read the text. To customize outside of the suggested combinations below, we recommend using this [color contrast testing tool](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/). For more information, read our [accessibility standards](/guides/accessibility).

  componentId="utilities-color"
  stories={{'text': {name: 'text'}}}

/>

You can set the color inheritance on an element by using the `color-fg-inherit` class.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-color"
  stories={{'text-inherit': {name: 'text-inherit'}}}
  height="60"
/>

## Background

Background colors are most commonly used for filling large blocks of content or areas with a color. When selecting a background color, make sure the foreground color contrast passes a minimum WCAG accessibility rating of [level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). Meeting these standards ensures that content is accessible by everyone, regardless of disability or user device. You can [check your color combination with this demo site](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/). For more information, read our [accessibility standards](/guides/accessibility).
