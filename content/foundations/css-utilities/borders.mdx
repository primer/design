## Default border

The default border utility applies a solid, 1px border, with a default gray color.

Borders can be applied to a specific edge or to the X and Y axes individually:

Remove borders from all sides or a single side with `.border-0`, `.border-top-0`, `.border-right-0`, `.border-bottom-0`, `.border-left-0`.

## Responsive borders

You can adjust border widths on all sides or each side individually with responsive border utilities:

- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` adds borders on all sides at and above the breakpoint. The `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` shorthand is also supported.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-0` removes borders from all sides at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)` adds a border on the given side at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)-0` the border from the given side at and above the breakpoint.

## Border colors

Border colors are documented on the [colors utilities page](/foundations/css-utilities/colors#border).

## Rounded corners

Use the following utilities to add or remove rounded corners: `rounded-0` removes rounded corners, `rounded-1` applies a border radius of 4px, `rounded-2` applies a border radius of 6px, and `rounded-3` applies a border radius of 8px. `.circle` applies a border radius of 50%, which turns square elements into perfect circles.

You can also add rounded corners to each edge (top, right, bottom, left) with the following utilities:

## Responsive rounded corners

You can adjust border radius on all sides or each side individually with responsive border radius utilities:

- `rounded-(sm|md|lg|xl)` adds a 6px rounded corner on all sides at and above the breakpoint.
- `rounded-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(0|1|2|3|4)` adds a rounded corner on all sides at and above the breakpoint.
- `rounded-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)-(0|1|2|3|4)` adds a rounded corner on the given side at and above the breakpoint.
