Remove borders from all sides or a single side with `.border-0`, `.border-top-0`, `.border-right-0`, `.border-bottom-0`, `.border-left-0`.

## Responsive borders

You can adjust border widths on all sides or each side individually with responsive border utilities:

- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` adds borders on all sides at and above the breakpoint. The `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` shorthand is also supported.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-0` removes borders from all sides at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)` adds a border on the given side at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)-0` the border from the given side at and above the breakpoint.
