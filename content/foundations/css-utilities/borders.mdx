## Default border

The default border utility applies a solid, 1px border, with a default gray color.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'default': {name: 'Default'}}}
  height="80"
/>

Borders can be applied to a specific edge or to the X and Y axes individually:

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'direction': {name: 'Direction'}}}
  height="340"
/>

Remove borders from all sides or a single side with `.border-0`, `.border-top-0`, `.border-right-0`, `.border-bottom-0`, `.border-left-0`.

  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'hide': {name: 'Hide'}}}
  height="80"
/>

## Border style

Use `border-dashed` to give an element a dashed border.

  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'style': {name: 'Style'}}}
  height="80"
/>

## Rounded corners

Use the following utilities to add or remove rounded corners: `rounded-0` removes rounded corners, `rounded-1` applies a border radius of 4px, `rounded-2` applies a border radius of 6px, and `rounded-3` applies a border radius of 8px. `.circle` applies a border radius of 50%, which turns square elements into perfect circles.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'rounded': {name: 'Rounded'}}}
  height="360"
/>

You can also add rounded corners to each edge (top, right, bottom, left) with the following utilities:

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'rounded-direction': {name: 'Rounded Direction'}}}
  height="240"
/>

## Responsive borders

You can adjust border widths on all sides or each side individually with responsive border utilities:

- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` adds borders on all sides at and above the breakpoint. The `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)` shorthand is also supported.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-0` removes borders from all sides at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)` adds a border on the given side at and above the breakpoint.
- `border-(sm|md|lg|xl)-(top|right|bottom|left)-0` the border from the given side at and above the breakpoint.

<StorybookEmbed
  framework="css"
  componentId="utilities-border"
  stories={{'responsive': {name: 'Responsive'}}}
  height="150"
/>

## Border colors

Border colors are documented on the [colors utilities page](/foundations/css-utilities/colors#border).
