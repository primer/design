title: Responsive design
description: Supporting responsive experiences is an essential part of developing for the Web today. Every page and feature at GitHub needs to be responsive to the user’s device and their preferences.

## Definition

Nielsen Norman Group [defines Responsive Web Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/responsive-web-design-definition/) as “a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it”.

“Adaptive design”, on the other hand, has been a term historically used to identify an approach where entirely separated fixed layouts were created to support mobile devices (MDN has good documentation [on how we got here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design#historic_website_layouts)).

“Responsive design” at GitHub is inherently adaptive, in the sense that it should not only adjust layout and spacing when resizing a page, but support patterns and component variants that match the paradigms and affordances of the person’s device:

- Responsive to the form factor: adapt to viewport size, pointing device support, and to the device metaphors and affordances.
- Responsive to the user preferences: respect browser’s default font size, reduced motion, color scheme, contrast preferences, etc.

### Responsive to the form factor



Users can access GitHub from a variety of devices, all with different form factors and capabilities. Browsers can be found in smartphones, laptops, and desktop computers, but also in  to tiny  GitHub needs to adapt its 

, and to the context in which they are using it.

A page and its content needs to work without loss of information or functionality

To make sure pages remain accessible in different scenarios, pages need to be designed to support small viewports without loss of information or functionality. This includes small devices, and scenarios where a computer has browser zoom enabled.

#### Viewport size

Pages should adapt to the viewport size, without loss of information or functionality, starting at the following dimensions:

- **Minimum viewport width**: 320px
- **Minimum viewport height**: 256px

When designing a mobile-friendly rendering of a page, we recommend using a viewport width of **375px**, as this is the most common size among small smartphones. However, the page should still be tested and be fully functional at smaller widths.

Providing support at these sizes enable people with low vision to use GitHub with a browser zoom enabled, up to 400% on a 1280px wide screen. [Read more about the Reflow accessibility requirement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html).

#### Pointing device

&nbsp; | `pointer: coarse`| `pointer: fine`
---------------|------------------|-----------------
**`hover: none`**  | Smartphones, touch screens | Stylus-based screens
**`hover: hover`** | Virtual reality, video-game controllers | Mouse, touch pad

Fine / coarse

Hover support

### Responsive to the user preferences

People may set system preferences to change the way they prefer to interact with their devices. By default, GitHub must respect these preferences. Providing a way to override these preferences is recommended.

On the web, these user preference media features include:

- [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- [`prefers-contrast`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast)
- [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
- [`forced-colors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors)
- [`inverted-colors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/inverted-colors)

#### Browser default font size

Users may set their operating system or browsers to use larger or smaller fonts.

GitHub should respect these preferences by adopting Primer’s `rem`-unit based relative sizing throughout.
