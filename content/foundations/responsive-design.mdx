title: Responsive design
description: Supporting responsive experiences is an essential part of developing for the Web. Every page and feature at GitHub needs to adapt to the user’s device and their preferences.

## Definition

Nielsen Norman Group [defines Responsive Web Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/responsive-web-design-definition/) as “a web development approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website, depending on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it”.

“Adaptive design”, on the other hand, has been a term historically used to identify an approach where entirely separated fixed layouts were created to support mobile devices (MDN has good documentation [on how we got here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design#historic_website_layouts)).

“Responsive design” at GitHub is inherently adaptive, in the sense that it should not only adjust layout and spacing when resizing a page, but support patterns and component variants that match the paradigms and affordances of the person’s device:

- Responsive to the form factor: adapt to viewport size, pointing device support, and to the device metaphors and affordances.
- Responsive to the user preferences: respect browser’s default font size, reduced motion, color scheme, contrast preferences, etc.

## Responsive to the device’s form factor

Designing for the web means that people can open your page from virtually any type of device. When designing for GitHub, picture our users using desktops, tablets, and smartphones, but also [custom-built tiny cyberdecks](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/top/?t=year) and [VR headsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset).

### Viewport size

To guarantee maximum compatibility, pages should adapt to the [browser’s viewport size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Viewport_concepts), without loss of information or functionality, starting at the following dimensions:

- **Minimum viewport width**: 320px
- **Minimum viewport height**: 256px

Providing support at these smaller sizes enable people with low vision to use GitHub with a browser zoom enabled, up to 400% on a 1280px wide screen. [Read more about this accessibility requirement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html).

To understand how to break down a page into regions for a responsive adaptation, check out [Responsive foundations](/foundations/layout#responsive-foundations) and [Responsive behavior](/foundations/layout#responsive-behavior) sections in the [Layout](/foundations/layout) page.

> When designing a mobile-friendly rendering of a page, we recommend using a viewport width of **375px**, as this is the most common size among small smartphones. However, the page should still be tested and be fully functional at smaller widths for accessibility reasons, all the way to **320px**.

### Pointing device

#### Pointer types
- A `coarse` pointer means the primary input mechanism isn’t very accurate. A finger on a touchscreen is a coarse pointer.
- A `fine` pointer means the primary input mechanism supports accurate control. A mouse or a stylus is a fine pointer.

- **Minimum fine/mouse target**: 20px
- **Minimum coarse/touch target**: 44px

When designing for coarse/touch, make sure that the target size is large enough to be easily tapped. [Read more about this accessibility requirement](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/target-size.html).

#### Hover support

Browsers report if the primary input mechanism can hover over elements with the `hover` media feature.

&nbsp; | `pointer: coarse`| `pointer: fine`
---------------|------------------|-----------------
**`hover: none`**  | Smartphones, touch screens | Stylus-based screens
**`hover: hover`** | Virtual reality headsets, video-game controllers | Mouse, touch pad

## Responsive to the user preferences

People may set system preferences to change the way they prefer to interact with their devices. By default, GitHub must respect these preferences. Providing a way to override these options within the **User settings** is also recommended.

On the web, these user preference media features include:

- [`prefers-color-scheme`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
- [`prefers-contrast`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-contrast)
- [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
- [`forced-colors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/forced-colors)
- [`inverted-colors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/inverted-colors)

### Browser default font size

Users may set their operating system or browsers to use larger or smaller fonts. GitHub should respect these preferences, as it enables people with low vision to increase the size of the text on the page.

Primer design tokens are designed to support `rem` units, which are relative to the browser’s default font size. Use Primer-provided design tokens to ensure consistency across the system.

To test this, change the size in the browser:

- In Chrome: Go to `chrome://settings`. Under **Appearance**, change the font size.
- In Firefox: In the menu button, select **Settings**. Under ”Language and Appearance” you can set different size. Default is `16`.
