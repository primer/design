## Guidelines

### Assure adequate color contrast

Color contrast between text and its background must meet [required WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

The contrast requirements are:

- 4.5:1 for normal text
- 3:1 for large text (>24px)
- 3:1 for UI elements and graphics
- No contrast requirement for decorative and disabled elements

Use an [online contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or a [Figma plugin](/guides/accessibility/tools#contrast-plugin) to test your contrast.

### Don't rely on color alone

<Box
  mb={3}
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  alignItems="center"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 3}}
>
  <Box as="p" mt="0">
    <Heading sx={{mt: 0, mb: 3, fontSize: 2}} as="h4">
      Show state with more than color
    </Heading>
    Color vision deficiency is different for different people. To make sure everyone can understand and use your UI you should
    show state with more than a change in color. For example by using icons or changing the content.
  </Box>
  <img
    width="456"
    alt="Example icon that uses a distinct shape in addition to color to indicate an error."

</Box>

<Box

  display="flex"

  alignItems="start"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 3}}

  <Box as="p" mt="0">
    <Heading sx={{mt: 0, mb: 3, fontSize: 2}} as="h4">
      Connect labels to graphs with lines or patterns
    </Heading>
    For charts and graphs you can position the labels on top or close to each section. You can also use patterns to distinguish
    different parts.
  </Box>
  <img
    width="456"
    alt="Two graphs. One is a line graph and one is a pie graph. The line graph is demonstrating using unique shapes for each comparison line's plot symbol. The pie chart is demonstrating how each slice's label can use a line to point to its corresponding slide."
