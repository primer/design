title: Color
---

Color plays a critical role in an interface’s usability. It helps the user know which actions to take, and understand hierarchy and relationships between elements.
Primer’s color system is composed of different color modes, with their own color scale. Colors are named based on the function they perform in the interface.

## Color modes
GitHub's UI can be rendered in a variety of different color modes. Every element on GitHub’s interface maps to a color in the scale for each color mode.

## Foundations
Foundation variables are the building blocks of all interfaces. Use them to create layouts and content.

| Variable | Role |
| -------- | -------- |
| `canvas-default`     | Main UI backgrounds. It's used in most components and surfaces.     |
| ~~`canvas-subtle`~~     | 🟡 Deprecating soon     |
| `canvas-overlay`     | Surface on elements that are displayed with elevation. For example, dropdowns and popovers.     |
| `canvas-inset`     | Surface on views where the content is the primary focus. For example, feeds and timelines.     |
| `border-default`     | Main border to create boundaries. Critical to understanding the interface's hierarchy.    |
| `border-muted`     | Secondary border to emphasize separation between elements.     |
| `border-subtle`    | Low opacity border designed to blend with backgrounds like images on avatars or primary buttons.     |
| `fg-default`    | Provides high readability. Default text and icons, and most foregrounds.      |
| `fg-muted`    | Provides medium readability. Used to create hierarchy in combination with `fg-default`.      |
| `fg-subtle`    | Provides low contrast. Used for placeholder text.      |
| `fg-on-emphasis`    | Used for text and icons on color backgrounds.     |

## Color roles 
Color roles are defined by the meaning they convey in the UI. Primer has 8 color roles with 4 variants each.

## How to use Primer colors?

Primer colors exist in different formats and are made available throughout the Primer libraries and tools. Not all colors exist everywhere and the naming depends on the Primer library. Below a list to help find the right Primer color documentation that is specific to that role and environment.
