title: Color
---

Color plays a critical role in an interfaceâ€™s usability. It helps the user know which actions to take, and understand hierarchy and relationships between elements.
Primerâ€™s color system is composed of different color modes, with their own color scale. Colors are named based on the function they perform in the interface.

## Color modes
GitHub's UI can be rendered in a variety of different color modes. Every element on GitHubâ€™s interface maps to a color in the scale for each color mode.

## Foundations
Foundation variables are the building blocks of all interfaces. Use them to create layouts and content.

| Variable | Role |
| -------- | -------- |
| `canvas-default`     | Main UI backgrounds. It's used in most components and surfaces.     |
| ~~`canvas-subtle`~~     | ðŸŸ¡ Deprecating soon     |
| `canvas-overlay`     | Surface on elements that are displayed with elevation. For example, dropdowns and popovers.     |
| `canvas-inset`     | Surface on views where the content is the primary focus. For example, feeds and timelines.     |
| `border-default`     | Main border to create boundaries. Critical to understanding the interface's hierarchy.    |
| `border-muted`     | Secondary border to emphasize separation between elements.     |
| `border-subtle`    | Low opacity border designed to blend with backgrounds like images on avatars or primary buttons.     |
| `fg-default`    | Provides high readability. Default text and icons, and most foregrounds.      |
| `fg-muted`    | Provides medium readability. Used to create hierarchy in combination with `fg-default`. Do not use for placeholder or disabled states.      |
| `fg-subtle`    | Provides low contrast. Used for disabled states â€” in these cases, it's acceptable that it does not pass general text contrast requirements.      |
| `fg-on-emphasis`    | Used for text and icons on color backgrounds.     |

## Color roles 
Color roles are defined by the meaning they convey in the UI. Primer has 8 color roles with 4 variants each.
