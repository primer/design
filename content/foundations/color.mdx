Color plays a critical role in an interfaceâ€™s usability. It helps the user know which actions to take, and understand hierarchy and relationships between elements.

Primerâ€™s color system is composed of different color modes, with their own color scale. Colors are named based on the function they perform in the interface.



## Foundations

| Variable | Role |
| -------- | -------- |
| `canvas-default`     | Main UI surface. Most of the work happens in it.     |
| ~~`canvas-subtle`~~     | ðŸŸ¡ Deprecating soon     |
| `canvas-overlay`     | Main surface on UI elements with elevation. Ex. Popovers     |
| `canvas-inset`     | Areas where more focus is needed. Ex. Feeds or timelines     |
| `border-default`     | Main border to create boundaries. Critical to understanding the interface's hierarchy.    |
| `border-muted`     | Secondary border to emphasize separation between elements     |
| `border-subtle`    | Low opacity border designed to blend with backgrounds like images on avatars or primary buttons     |
| `fg-default`    | Default text and icons, high readability. ~98% of foregrounds      |
| `fg-muted`    | Medium-readability. used to create hierarchy in combination with normal. don't use for placeholder or disabled states      |
| `fg-subtle`    | low contrast used for disabled states. Itâ€™s ok that it doesnâ€™t pass the contrast requirements for text.  Quotes, disabled states, placeholders?     |
| `fg-on-emphasis`    | Text and icons to use and color backgrounds     |
