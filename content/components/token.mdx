## Overview

Tokens almost always appear in a group. A group of tokens may be read-only, or they may be used as a way to input data.

A read-only group of tokens organizes information in a way that helps users quickly scan and understand the view they're on. For example, a list of topics associated with a repository.

Tokens may be used for data input to quickly add and remove items to a list of related attributes. For example, defining a list of GitHub users who can access a private repo.

## Interactivity

Tokens are almost always interactive. When a token is interactive, it will react to cursor hover and keyboard focus.

While tokens may have the same interactivity as a button or a link, a token should not be used as a replacement for a button.

If a token is a link or button _and_ it has a remove button, keyboard focus will only go to the link/button. Keyboard users can remove a token by focusing the link/button and pressing "Backspace" or "Delete". When a screen reader is focused on a removable token, it will read the token's label and tell users to press "Backspace" or "Delete" to remove it.

Examples of interactions:

- An issue label token that links to a list of issues with that label
- A user token that shows a profile summary dialog on hover

## Sizing

  <Box>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">
      Different token sizes can be used to maintain visual harmony with the other content on the screen or to maintain a
      comfortable touch target for interactive tokens.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">
      Keep visual hierarchy in mind. Large tokens should not visually compete with elements that have a higher priority.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">A group of tokens should not have tokens of different sizes.</Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

  />
  <Box>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">
      A group of tokens should flow like words in a paragraph, not a vertical list. This keeps the group compact to
      improve scannability.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">Tokens that represent different types of data should not be grouped together.</Box>
    <Box as="p">Interactive tokens should not be grouped with non-interactive tokens.</Box>
  </Box>

  <Box>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">
      When space is limited, like in a table, some tokens in a group may be hidden. The amount hidden tokens is added in
      a text label, e.g. `+3`. Make sure to add an accessible label like `3 more tokens` to make this screen reader
      accessible.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">
      It is important to make sure that the detail view of the list item allows users to access all tokens.

### Within a text input field

  <img

  />
  <Box>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">
      By default, tokens wrap to the next line and expand the height of the input. This allows users to see many tokens
      at once.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">
      To limit how large the input can grow, a maximum height can be defined. After the input grows past that maximum
      height, it will scroll vertically.
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

<Box
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 4}}

  <img
    width="456"
    alt="tokens rendered at all sizes"

  />
  <Box as="p" mt="0">
    If the input is being used in a spot where the input height cannot grow, tokens can be forced to a single line that
    scrolls horizontally.
  </Box>
</Box>

## Tokens as a way to enter information

<Box
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 4}}
>
  <img
    width="456"
    alt="text input with tokens inside with an autocomplete menu below it"
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/137771742-0d6553f2-1d34-44c2-bfcb-f39c56b5b3d1.png"
  />
  <Box>
    <Box as="p" mt="0">
      If tokens are being used for data input, it should be obvious that the user is in an edit or creation context.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">
      Tokens can be added or removed from a group in the way that makes the most sense for your use case. We recommend
      using an <a href="/components/autocomplete">autocomplete</a> component to allow users to sort through a
      list to pick options.
    </Box>
    <Box as="p">
      The remove button is the recommended way for removing a token from a group, but you can hide it if there is a
      simple alternative that makes more sense for your use case. You can also keep the remove button visible while
      still providing other ways to remove the button from a group.
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Box>

## Accessibility

To make tokens accessible to keyboard users and those who require accessible contrasts, make sure to fulfill the requirements below.

- `4.5:1` contrast between the label (text and icon) of the token and it's background
- when in focus a token must have a visible focus outline
- if a token can be removed, the keyboard focus must be moved to the previous token after deletion. If no token remains, it must focus on the input itself.
- if a close button is used, it’s name should use the token’s label to make it unique
