## Accessibility

### Focus management vs. a live region

There was [extensive research](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/toast-flash-banner/accessible-banner-prototype.md#engineering-explorations-of-an-accessible-banner) done to determine how best to surface banners in the most accessible way. The answer is, it depends! You can reference the [accessible banner prototype docs](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/toast-flash-banner/accessible-banner-prototype.md#engineering-explorations-of-an-accessible-banner) for a very detailed explanation of scenarios tested.

When deciding whether to focus a banner or use a live region, consider the following:

* The criticality of the information - critical information (such as an error) should be as discoverable as possible
* Where is a user's focus when the banner appears; would focus otherwise be lost if the banner is not focused?
* Is there already a live region on the page that can be utilized? [Dynamic live regions can have some challenges](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/toast-flash-banner/accessible-banner-prototype.md#challenges-with-dynamically-inserted-live-region), so this method requires ample testing.

If you decide focusing the banner is the approach to go with, follow the [accessibility guidance in the Rails docs](https://primer.style/components/banner/rails/alpha#accessibility).
