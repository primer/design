## Accessibility

### Focus management vs. Live region announcement

Banner can be used in one of two ways:

* To highlight prominent information on a page.
* To communicate feedback in response to a user action.

Specifically, the latter scenario of communicating feedback requires the use of focus management or a live region announcement to guarantee that all users are immediately made aware of the feedback. This relates to [WCAG 4.1.3 Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html).

Relevant scenarios where a focus management or a live region technique come into play to draw attention to the Banner include:

* A user submits a form; An error banner is shown with a list of form errors that needs to be corrected.
* A user submits a form; The submission successfully goes through and the form container is replaced with new content which includes a success banner.
* A user saves a setting; An error banner is shown communicating that an unexpected error has occured and the setting was not saved.

How should one accessibly surface a feedback Banner? The answer is, it depends! You can reference the [accessible banner prototype docsÂ (GitHub Staff only)](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/toast-flash-banner/accessible-banner-prototype.md#engineering-explorations-of-an-accessible-banner) for a very detailed explanation of scenarios tested.

When deciding whether to focus a banner or use a live region, consider the following:

* How critical is the information?
  * Critical information (such as an error) should be made as discoverable as possible. While moving focus to the Banner can be considered more disruptive than a live region announcement, it's more important that a user is able to discover the Banner so they can take an appropriate action. Prefer placing focus on the Banner over using a live region announcement in critical scenarios.
  * For communicating non-critical information (such as a success), a live region announcement is sufficient in **most** scenarios. Keep in mind that a live region announcement can sometimes fail to fire and can easily be missed, so it should be reserved for use on non-critical information.
* Does the Banner contain an action?
  * If the Banner contains an action, placing focus on the Banner is preferable so that a screen reader user can immediately interact with the action without having to manually locate it.
* Is there already a live region on the page that can be utilized?
  * [Dynamic live regions can have some challenges](https://github.com/github/accessibility/blob/main/docs/coaching-recommendations/toast-flash-banner/accessible-banner-prototype.md#challenges-with-dynamically-inserted-live-region), so this method requires ample testing.
