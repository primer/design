## Usage

Use a radio button in a [radio group](/components/radio-group) to allow users to select one option from a short list of options.

See the [radio group guidelines](/components/radio-group) for more information about usage.

### States

Radio buttons have static dimensions and three different states when checked or unchecked: rest (default), focus, and disabled.

### Best practices

- A radio button may not be used on its own: it _must_ be rendered in a group of related radio buttons using a [radio group](/components/radio-group).
- Radio buttons cannot be unchecked, so only use radio buttons when a selection is required
- An individual radio should not have its own validation message or style. Instead, show a validation message on the [radio group](/components/radio-group). For more information, see the [Validation Message](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#validation) section in the Forms documentation.
- An individual radio button cannot be marked as required. Instead, make a selection required using the [radio group](/components/radio-group). For more information, see the [Required field indicator](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#required-field-indicator) in the Forms documentation.
