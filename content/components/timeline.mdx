## Usage

Timeline displays items on a connected vertical timeline. It's primarily used to document the history and activity of a given pull request or issue.

## Accessibility

### Timeline breaks

The `Timeline.Break` component allows for content in `Timeline` to be visually seperated. This should be used for decorative purposes only. Since this component is decorative, it is not conveyed to assistive technologies like screen readers.

The content within `Timeline.Item` should clearly communicate the status and state of that item, so that if there is a need to seperate content, the context of the seperation is communicated in `Timeline.Item`.
