description: Components that are shared by GitHub feature teams, but are not publicly available in Primer yet.

<Note>This information is only relevant to GitHub staff.</Note>

These components support new design patterns that have been piloted by feature teams outside of Primer. While we encourage relying only on Primer components, we also value exploring new ideas without the exhaustive vetting process required for inclusion in Primer.

To ensure consistency and seamless collaboration, we recommend sharing these components with other teams by developing them as React components within the `ui/packages/` monorepo. This monorepo, along with the larger monolith, provides a solid foundation with baseline configurations for linting, accessibility scanning using Axe, and Storybook previews.

For more information about introducing new design patterns, refer to our documentation on [handling new patterns](/guides/contribute/handling-new-patterns).

## Upstreaming to Primer

Should a design pattern from the `ui/packages/` monorepo gain widespread adoption, it becomes a strong candidate for upstreaming into Primer. If your component is data-dependent or feature-specific, our Primer maintainers can help evolve it into a more versatile pattern suitable for multiple use-cases.

For more information on the upstreaming process and how existing components can be included in Primer, refer to our documentation on [upstreaming existing components](/guides/contribute/adding-new-components#upstreaming-to-primer).

## Finding these components

GitHub shared components are documented in a private Storybook instance: [ui/packages/ Storybook](https://gh.io/storybook) (only available to GitHub staff).

Please note that these components will not exist in our Figma component library, [Primer Web](https://www.figma.com/file/GCvY3Qv8czRgZgvl1dG6lp/Primer-Web?type=design&node-id=1406%3A0&mode=design&t=Qi8hXoRhKLLrDhgf-1), until they have been successfully upstreamed into Primer.
