## Usage

The details component displays information that can be toggled open or closed. It includes a summary followed by content thatâ€™s revealed after triggering a button. Use Details to reveal additional information that the user can show and hide by triggering a button. 

By default, the information is hidden. When triggered, it expands and displays the information.
