<Note>

  The [underline nav](/components/underline-nav) guidelines cover the design guidelines not mentioned here.

  The guidelines on this page only highlight the differences between underline panels and underline nav.

</Note>

## Usage

Underlined panels let users switch between 2 or more related panels of content without changing the URL or leaving their current context.

If you want to use this pattern for tabs that change the URL when activated, use the [underline nav](/components/underline-nav) component instead.

### Best practices

- One of the tabs should be selected by default when the user loads the page.
- Avoid overwhelming the user with too many tabs. If you have too many tabs, try grouping your content into broader categories or exposing more of the content on the page without requiring the user to click into a tab.
- Each view should have enough information so the user can complete their tasks without switching back and forth between tabs.
- Views should be able to be navigated in any order. This is not a pattern for navigating stepped flows.

## Accessibility

<Box
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 3}}
>

<div>

Underline panels are made of the following ARIA roles:

- `tablist`: the container wrapping the tabs
- `tab`: each individual tab
- `tabpanel`: the container wrapping the content associated with each tab

The active tab is conveyed to assistive technologies using the `aria-selected` attribute. Each tab is associated with it's corresponding panel using the `aria-controls` attribute.

</div>

<img
  width="456"
  role="presentation"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/63c0312a-1e74-4990-b4bf-1795e5f3640d"
/>

</Box>

### Keyboard navigation

Underline panels' tabs follow the [automatic activation pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-automatic/). This means that when a tab receives focus, the tab is activated and the associated panel is displayed.

<!-- TODO: revise this guidance once we change to the manual activation pattern. This was discussed in A11y Office Hours on 02/27/2024: https://github.com/github/accessibility/issues/5623#issuecomment-1967930432 -->
<!-- Underline panels' tabs follow the [manual activation pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-manual/). This decision was made so users don't unintentionally trigger the side effects of rendering a new tab panel while they're navigating the tab list. For example, activating a new tab could trigger a network request to fetch new content. -->
