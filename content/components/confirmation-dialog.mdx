ConfirmationDialog helps prevent users from accidentally performing destructive or irreversible actions by requiring explicit confirmation. It provides a clear, focused interface that interrupts the user's workflow to ensure they understand the consequences of their action.

### Header region

The **header** region contains the confirmation title and close button. The title should clearly describe the action being confirmed, typically phrased as a question (e.g., "Delete repository?", "Discard changes?").

### Body content

The **body** provides additional context about the action's consequences. This may include:
- A description of what will happen
- Warning text about irreversibility
- Lists of affected items
- Input fields for confirmation (such as typing a repository name)

### Action buttons

The **action region** contains the primary action button (usually destructive) and a secondary cancel button. The destructive action should use the `danger` variant to clearly indicate its nature.

## Usage

Use ConfirmationDialog when:

- The action is destructive and cannot be easily undone (deleting, removing, etc.)
- The action has significant consequences that users should be aware of
- You need to interrupt the user's workflow to ensure intentional action
- Additional confirmation input is required (typing names, selecting options)

### When not to use

- For non-destructive actions that can be easily undone
- When the action is clearly reversible
- For simple confirmations that don't warrant a modal interruption
- When the context already makes the consequences clear

## Variants

### Basic confirmation

A simple confirmation dialog with descriptive text and action buttons.

```jsx
<ConfirmationDialog
  title="Delete repository?"
  confirmButtonText="Delete"
  confirmButtonType="danger"
  onConfirm={handleDelete}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
>
  This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete the repository
  and all of its contents.
</ConfirmationDialog>
```

### Input confirmation

A confirmation dialog that requires additional input for verification.

```jsx
<ConfirmationDialog
  title="Delete repository?"
  confirmButtonText="Delete"
  confirmButtonType="danger"
  onConfirm={handleDelete}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
  requireConfirmation
  confirmationText={repositoryName}
>
  This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete the repository
  and all of its contents.
  
  Please type <strong>{repositoryName}</strong> to confirm.
</ConfirmationDialog>
```

## Options

### Size

ConfirmationDialogs support different sizes to accommodate varying amounts of content:

- **Small**: For simple confirmations with minimal text
- **Medium** (default): For standard confirmations with moderate content
- **Large**: For confirmations with extensive details or lists

### Confirmation types

- **Basic**: Simple yes/no confirmation
- **Input verification**: Requires typing specific text to confirm
- **Multi-step**: Progressive confirmation for highly destructive actions

## Accessibility

<AccessibilityLink label="ConfirmationDialog" />

ConfirmationDialog follows standard dialog accessibility patterns:

- Focuses on the first interactive element when opened
- Traps focus within the dialog
- Returns focus to the triggering element when closed
- Supports keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape)
- Provides appropriate ARIA labels and roles

### Screen reader considerations

- The title should clearly describe the confirmation action
- Body content should provide sufficient context about consequences
- Button labels should be descriptive and action-oriented
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate body content with the dialog
