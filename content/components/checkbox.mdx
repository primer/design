## Usage

Use checkboxes to allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items, or to mark one individual item as selected.

### States

Checkboxes have static dimensions and three different states: rest (default), focus, and disabled.

### Selected states

Checkboxes are capable of showing two forms of selection: checked (left) or indeterminate (right).

### Best practices

- An individual checkbox should not have its own validation message or style. Instead, show a validation message on the [checkbox group](/components/checkbox-group). For more information, see the [Validation Message](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#validation) section in the Forms documentation.
- While there are certain use cases where an individual checkbox may be required, the most common use case is to require a selection from a [checkbox group](/components/checkbox-group). In this case, an individual checkbox button should not be marked as required, but the checkbox group should be marked as required instead. For more information, see the [Required field indicator](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#required-field-indicator) in the Forms documentation.
