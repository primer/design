## Usage

Use checkboxes to allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items, or to mark one individual item as selected.

### States

Checkboxes have static dimensions and three different states: rest (default), focus, and disabled.

/>

### Selected states

Checkboxes are capable of showing two forms of selection: checked (left) or indeterminate (right).

### Best practices

- An individual checkbox or radio should not have its own validation message or style. For more information, see the [Validation Message](../ui-patterns/forms#validation) section in the Forms documentation.

- An individual checkbox or radio button cannot be marked as required. For more information, see the [Required field indicator](../ui-patterns/forms/#required-field-indicator) in the Forms documentation.

- A selection can be marked as required using a [checkbox group](/components/checkbox-group).
