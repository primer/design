## Usage

This component does not include any styling. It formats a timestamp as a localized string or as relative text that auto-updates in the user's browser.

For more information about Primer's patterns for date and tme formatting, see the "[Dates and times](/ui-patterns/dates-and-times)" UI pattern guidelines.

## Options

### Verbosity

**Auto**: "Apr 1, 2014"

**Micro**: "9y"

**Elapsed:** "9y 1m 15d 17h 28m 51s", and changes in real time.

### Precision

You can choose how pricisely you want to display the time. By default the time is displayed all the way down to the second (for example, 9y 1m 15d 17h 26m 39s), but for times that were far in the past you can be as vague as rounding to years (for example, 9y).

### Word formatting

By default, the time will be prefixed with "on", but this can be customized.

Weekday names and month names are fully written out by default, but they may be abbreviated.

### Number formatting

Any part of the time can be rendered with or without a leading zero.
