## Usage

Icons are most appropriate for representing simple, recognizable concepts or actions. When choosing icons for your design system, consider the following guidelines:

1. Where possible use icons to supplement text, rather than replacing it.
2. Be sure that the meaning of icons is clear when used without accompanying text..
3. Choose icons that are easily recognizable and accurately depict the intended concept or action.
4. Maintain consistency in the use of icons across your product or brand to establish a cohesive visual language.
5. Avoid using icons for complex or abstract concepts that may be confusing to some users.
6. Adhere to predetermined icon sizes to ensure legibility and ease of recognition.
7. Test the effectiveness of your icons with users to ensure that they are understood and useful in navigating the interface.

## Color

To ensure that icons are effective and legible in different color modes, it is recommended to use our [functional foreground colors](/foundations/color#foregrounds). This helps to maintain consistency and ensures that the icons convey the intended meaning to users.

In some cases, certain icons should always be paired with specific colors in order to effectively convey their intended meaning and provide a consistent user experience. Here are a few examples:

Many of our components are designed to automatically set the color of icons to a predetermined color. For example, buttons are configured to set the icon to our functional `fg.muted` by default.

## Sizes

<img

  alt="The x-circle icon shown in three different sizes."

/>

Octicons are available in three sizes: `12px`, `16px` and `24px`. To maintain consistency in stroke width and legibility, it is important to use these icons only at their designated sizes.

The smaller set of `12px` icons is available for use in specific, condensed user interface contexts. These icons are listed below and should only be used in the appropriate context.

| Icon                                                                      | Usage                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`alert-fill`](https://primer.style/octicons/alert-fill-12)               | For cautionary messaging or to inform the user that an action requires attention                                               |
| [`check-circle-fill`](https://primer.style/octicons/check-circle-fill-12) | For positive messaging to inform the user that an action is successful, complete, or that they may continue through a workflow |
| [`no-entry-fill`](https://primer.style/octicons/no-entry-fill-12)         | Indicate an ending or that the user is blocked and cannot continue                                                             |
| [`x-circle-fill`](https://primer.style/octicons/x-circle-fill-12)         | For negative messaging to inform the user that an error has occurred as a result of an action or an action is unavailable      |

Maintaining the original size of icons is important for visual consistency, legibility, accessibility, and simplifying the design process. Resizing icons should be avoided.

## System vs user-selectable

There are two types of icons: `system icons` and `user-selectable` icons.

System icons are used to represent core actions and concepts within the user interface. These icons are typically used consistently throughout the product and are an important part of our visual language. Examples of system icons might include a [trash](/octicons/trash-16) icon for deleting items, or a [plus-circle](/octicons/plus-circle-16) icon for adding new items.

User-selectable icons, on the other hand, are used to allow users to customize their experience or make a personal connection with the product. User-selectable icons are typically less central to the functionality of the user interface and may be changed by the user as desired.

At GitHub we currently use Emojies as user-selectable icons as they are widely recognized and understood, making them an effective way to convey emotions or personality. One benefit of using emojis as user-selectable icons is that they are visually distinct from the system icons used in the design system. This helps users to easily understand that the emojis are optional and can be selected by the user, rather than being a part of the core functionality of the user interface.

Allowing users to pick [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) (system icons) is strongly discouraged and could create a confusing experience when they are used in the wrong context. For example a user could pick a [issue-closed](https://primer.style/octicons/issue-closed-16) icon and use the label `In progress`.

</DoDontContainer>

Note that internally we had multiple discussions about introducing user-selectable octicons but no specific work or explorations have been started on this yet. This work initially would involve creating a set of octicons that look visually different from our existing style.

## Creating new icons

If you are unable to find the icon you need in our [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) library, you may want to create a new icon. Follow our [Octicons design guidelines](https://primer.style/octicons/guidelines/design) for guidance on creating a new icon that fits with the visual language of our design system. Keep in mind that new icons should be added only when they are necessary and meet the guidelines for use.
