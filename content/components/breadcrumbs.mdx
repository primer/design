## Usage

Breadcrumbs are used to show taxonomical context on pages that are many levels deep in a siteâ€™s hierarchy. Breadcrumbs show and link to pages higher up in the ancestry.

Breadcrumbs are most appropriate on pages that:

- Are many levels deep on a site
- Do not have a section-level navigation
- May need the ability to quickly go back to the previous (parent) page
- All items must contain links, with the last item as the user's current context

## Anatomy

Breadcrumbs are made of links (indicating parents), dividers, and the current page. The default breadcrumbs component can be modified to change the number of items within the chain.

/>

<Caption>Note: The space between items is set to 0px as the divider has padding built into it.</Caption>

## Options

### Breadcrumb length

By default the breadcrumbs component can show up to 10 items within the chain.
