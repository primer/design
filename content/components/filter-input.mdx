## Overview

A input that provides suggestions through qualifiers and highlights complex filter syntax.

## Content

### Icon

A filter input allows free form text searching as well as using qualifiers to apply filters to narrow down your search.
Since this filter input has to always support free form text searching using a filter icon could give the impression free form text search isn't available.
Therefore you should always use a search icon as a leading visual in the input.

### Overflow menu

When the buttons don't fit in the available space, an overflow button ("kebab" icon) is added at the end of the action bar signaling that there are more actions available. Clicking on the overflow button opens a menu with the remaining actions that didn't fit.

## Options

### Qualifiers

All qualifiers are predefined to ensure different products align on the same terminology as well as the design of suggestions.

#### Predefined

Even though custom qualifiers can be added it's important to check if your new qualifier could fit in one of the predefined qualifiers below.

⚠️ This list will change a lot over the next month to accomodate different teams.

### Sorting

There are two different states that should be considered when providing suggestions:

1. **Default**: You've entered a matching qualifier and get default suggestions. For example: `author:`.
2. **Narrow down**: You've entered a value after your qualifier to narrow down the suggestions. For example: `author:max`

<img

  role="presentation"

We should always strive to provide as relevant results as possible when dealing with `user`, `organization`, `repository`, `issue`, `pull request` items. This can be done through a mix of considerations:

1. Objects you've interacted with
2. Organizations you're part of and it's members
3. Repositories you're part of and it's members
4. [Approximate string matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) (fuzzy)

Let's take the `author:` as an example. During this `default` state we aren't searching through the authors yet and want to provide a default list with users.
In this case it's crucial we make those suggestions as relevant as possible therefore we rank them based on how often/recently you've interacted with them.

Once we start narrowing down those results by using `author:max` we enter the `narrow down` state and apply approximate string matching on those suggestions. In this case we still rank users that I've recently interacted with or that are part of my organization/repositories higher.

Sadly not all all infrastructure can currently apply this logic and therefore often we'll have to fall back on alphabetical ordering.

For static items that only return a handful of suggestions we often can just order items through common sense:

### Size

Filter inputs can have 3 different sizes:

- Small (`28px`)
- Medium (`32px`) (default)
- Large (`40px`)
