## Overview

Action lists can have many applications:

- They’re the foundation of [menus](/components/action-menu), [select panels](/components/selectpanel) and [nav lists](/components/nav-list).
- They can be applied to page sidebars for showing individual actions, handling local navigation, and displaying metadata

Action lists support section dividers and headers for grouping items, and individual item dividers for added clarity.

Action lists use a mobile-friendly inset style. Their sizes are adapted on touch devices, and their single-column format should render consistently in any screen size.

Items in an action list are generally interactive, and respond visually to `hover`, `active`, and `focus` states. Disabled and read-only items are also supported.

## Anatomy

An action list can be composed of:

- Action list items
- Item dividers
- Section headers (subtle or filled styles)
- Section dividers (subtle or filled styles)

        <Box as="p">Action list items support three different sizes: small, medium, and large. The small size is the default and most common option. Medium sizes work well for relaxed local navigation, while large sizes can support items that need more breathing room.</Box>
        <Box as="p">Sizes only grow vertically. This behavior keeps the content aligned among items, and retains horizontal space for density.</Box>
        <Box as="p">On touch devices, the large size is used at all times to ensure usability when tapping.</Box>
        <Box as="p">Be cautious when mixing different sizes in the same list to avoid inconsistency.</Box>

        <Box as="p">When listing system sections, features, or options, use leading visuals to improve the items' scannability. In user-generated objects, they can help to indicate the item's content type and status.</Box>

        <Box as="p">Trailing visual and trailing text can display auxiliary information. They're placed at the right of the item, and can denote status, keyboard shortcuts, or be used to set expectations about what the action does.</Box>
        <Box as="p">Note these side visuals don't have dedicated interaction targets.</Box>
        <Box as="p">

Use an [`arrow-right`](https://primer.style/octicons/arrow-right-16) octicon in menus to indicate the action will open more options, such as in a nested context. Use a [`pencil`](https://primer.style/octicons/pencil-16) octicon to indicate the item is going to be edited after clicking it.

</Box>
        <Box as="p">Custom trailing elements are supported, such as counters, labels, and other custom visuals that may help identify the item.</Box>
        <Box as="p">When using a trailing text for displaying keyboard shortcuts, always confirm the characters match with the user's operating system. For example, to indicate a bold action in a Markdown toolbar, use "Ctrl+B" on Linux and Windows, and "⌘B" on Mac. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">See reference for Mac keyboard glyphs</a>.</Box>

### Inactive items

Inactive action list item text still needs to meet an accessible color contrast ratio.

It's required to show a tooltip with context about why the item is inactive. It should be triggered by the alert icon in the leading visual or trailing visual.

If there's a leading visual, replace it with an alert icon.

If there's *not* a leading visual, the alert icon is put in the same position as the trailing visual.

See the [accessibility](#accessibility) section for information on the assistive technology user experience.

</Box>
<Box sx={{h3: {marginTop: 0}}}>

### Loading items

If an action list item is not yet interactive because the required data is still loading, it may be rendered in a loading state.

The position of the loading icon depends on the same logic as where the alert icon goes in inactive items:

If there's a leading visual, replace it with a loading indicator.

If there's *not* a leading visual, the loading indicator is put in the same position as the trailing visual.

## Accessibility

### Conveying filter results to assistive technologies

If an action list is being used to display a filtered list of options, a screen reader should announce when filtering is completed.

For more information, see the [conveying status (filter results)](/ui-patterns/loading#filter-results) section of the loading state pattern guidelines.

### Tooltips and dialogs on inactive items

<Box
  mb={3}
  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"
  justifyContent="space-between"
  flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']}
  sx={{gap: 3}}
>

<div>

If an action list item is inactive, it will no longer be an `<a>` or `<button>`, so it will not be focusable.

Having a tooltip on the leading visual is the only way to distinguish between the inactive items, and for keyboard-only screen reader users, it's the only way to see these are inactive.

The tooltip and optional dialog should be triggered by a button element that wraps the leading visual.
