## Options

### Single Selection

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/673b6671-47a8-46ed-9200-dc2a1710f374)

For single-item selection, the panel closes immediately upon selection. The selected item is indicated by a checkmark. Set the `selectionVariant` prop on `ActionList` to `single`.

### Multi Selection

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcf32736-35c9-42c2-837a-6a62767bbcec)

For multi-item selection, the panel remains open after each selection, allowing users to choose multiple items before closing the panel to confirm their choices. Selections are visually indicated by faux checkboxes. Set the `selectionVariant` prop on `ActionList` to `multiple`.

### Groups

Items can be grouped to provide additional context or to visually separate them. Each group can have a title for better organization.

### Footer

An optional footer at the bottom can include a link or button for additional actions.

### Opening

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90c9ffa3-302c-4a59-b8d3-5f8f747489bd)

Select panels can be activated via a semantic button, which can be either a regular button or an icon button. If the button represents the current selection, it must have an associated label, either internally (within the button) or externally (adjacent to the button).

## Anatomy

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4eaaba98-1fa7-4d7a-a243-0007cd4cc1b4)

The select panel consists of three main areas: a header, a scrollable list that can be filtered, and an optional footer:

- **Header**: Includes a title and a close button.
- **Input and List (scrollable)**: The scrollable list contains action list items, which can be either single or multi-select options. The input field allows users to quickly filter the list.
- **Footer**: Can contain an actionable button.

## Best Practices

### Empty State

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e4568fa-60be-44a3-b968-f2f0b6dcbb94)

When no results are available, offer users an explanation instead of leaving a blank space. There can be various reasons for the absence of results. It could be due to the search or filter input value not matching any available data, or it could be because the user has yet to generate any data to display.

### Loading

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd1e1d7-ad71-4820-ba8f-487a0462137f)

Provide visual cues to users when processes may take longer than expected. Use loading states at different stages to communicate effectively.

1. **Initial**: Use when retrieving initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list.
2. **Initial (skeleton)**: Use a skeleton loader when retrieving initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list.
3. **Searching/Filtering**: When users search for new items, maintain their current selections and use a minimal loading state to indicate ongoing activity.

### Current Selection

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f4dd86-ec9b-4a9e-8246-e92bed87fa00)

To make the current selection clear, display the selected items at the beginning of the list. This behavior should occur when opening the select panel, after users clear the input or when they change the filter value. Avoid reordering items after selection to prevent disorientation.

### Error/Warning Handling

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/272174b3-7f32-45cc-8ad1-9b063f8d98a4)

When things don't work as expected, or users need to be informed about important issues, we handle these scenarios appropriately. If default values fail to load, we display an error placeholder to inform the user. When users search for new values and the search fails, we display an error message above the input.

### Significant Actions

[SCREENSHOT]

When the selection triggers significant actions, such as deleting items, use a dialog with declarative buttons instead of the select panel. This ensures users are aware of the consequences of their actions.

## Behavior

The select panel opens when the trigger button is activated by a click, `Enter`, or `Space`.

### Interactions

Focus is initially placed on the input field and the first item in the list, which are connected as one focusable entity. Users can type to filter the list or navigate using `ArrowUp` and `ArrowDown`.

### Apply Changes

Closing the select panel applies all changes. It can be closed by clicking the trigger button again, the close button, clicking outside the panel, or pressing the `Esc` key.

### Keyboard Navigation

| Key           | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab`         | Move focus forward between interactive controls and widgets within the dialog.                                       |
| `Shift + Tab` | Move focus backward between interactive controls and widgets within the dialog.                                      |
| `Enter`       | Select items in the list or activate buttons or links within the select panel.                                       |
| `Space`       | Type a space in the input or activate buttons or links within the select panel.                                      |
| `ArrowDown`   | Navigate forward through items in the list. If focus is on the last item, `ArrowDown` moves focus to the first item. |
| `ArrowUp`     | Navigate backward through items in the list. If focus is on the first item, `ArrowUp` moves focus to the last item.  |
| `Home`        | Move focus to the first item in the list.                                                                            |
| `PageUp`      | Move focus to the first item in the list.                                                                            |
| `End`         | Move focus to the last item in the list.                                                                             |
| `PageDown`    | Move focus to the last item in the list.                                                                             |
| `Esc`         | Apply changes and close the select panel.                                                                            |
