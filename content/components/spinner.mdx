## Usage

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: 3}}>

<div>

A spinner is an indeterminate loading indicator, meaning it's best for cases where the progress or duration of a process is variable or unknown.

A spinner may be shown on it's own or paired with a loading message. Spinners may be used as a placeholder for loading content, or just as an indicator that some action is being processed.

More detailed guidance about designing for loading states can be found in our [loading guidelines](/ui-patterns/loading).

</Box>

## Options

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: 3}}>

<div>

### Size

The size of the spinner can be adjusted. The **medium** (default) variant works best for most cases. The **small** variant is optimized for being displayed inline with loading text. The **large** variant works well for replacing entire regions or pages that are still loading.

</Box>

## Accessibility

By default, our spinner component provides a generic loading status announcement for assistive technologies. We recommend that you specify a custom announcement specific to your use-case. For example: "Loading changed files".

To avoid duplicate announcements when a loading message is already being displayed in context, the component allows engineers to suppress the spinner's default loading announcement.
