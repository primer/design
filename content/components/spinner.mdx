## Usage

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: 3}}>

<div>

A spinner is an indeterminate loading indicator, meaning it's best for cases where the progress or duration of a process is variable or unknown.

A spinner may be shown on it's own or paired with a loading message. Spinners may be used as a placeholder for loading content, or just as an indicator that some action is being processed.

More detailed guidance about designing for loading states can be found in our [loading guidelines](/ui-patterns/loading).

</div>

</Box>

## Options

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: 3}}>

<div>

### Size

The size of the spinner can be adjusted. The **medium** (default) variant works best for most cases. The **small** variant is optimized for being displayed inline with loading text. The **large** variant works well for replacing entire regions or pages that are still loading.

</Box>

## Accessibility and usability expectations

Use the `Spinner` component to provide a visible loading indicator for situations where an asynchronous API call or process may take a moderate amount of time (between 1 and 3 seconds) – see [Adapting to different wait times](https://primer.style/ui-patterns/loading#adapting-to-different-wait-times)](https://primer.style/ui-patterns/loading#adapting-to-different-wait-times).

## Built-in accessibility features

The component only provides a visual, animated spinner icon. This icon is not exposed to screen readers, as it's an `<svg>` without a `role`, `aria-label`, or any text content.

```html
<svg height="32px" width="32px" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" class="Spinner__StyledSpinner…"> … </svg>
``` 
 
The spinner icon uses the default `currentColor` of its parent container. Unless authors specifically override the default colors, the icon meets minimum color contrast requirements on the canvas default white background.

## Implementation requirements
 
Do not rely solely on the `Spinner` component as a loading indicator, as it currently isn't exposed to screen readers, and has no built-in announcement.

Only use it as part of a fully realised solution (including `aria-live` notifications) for conveying loading/processing states. Refer to the [loading guidelines](https://primer.style/ui-patterns/loading) for more details.
 
## How to test the component

### Integration tests
 
- The component only provides a visual indicator, and passes color contrast. Additional solutions are required (such as the use of `aria-live` notifications in our [loading guidelines](https://primer.style/ui-patterns/loading)) to convey the loading state for screen reader users.

- If you are using custom colors, verify that the spinner's "spinning" section meets the minimum color contrast requirement of `3:1` against the background it's presented on

### Component tests

- The component renders an `<svg>` element without any text content (as otherwise this would be announced by screen readers)
