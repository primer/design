## Usage

Use form controls when requiring data input from the user. For example, creating a new repo configuring settings, and logging in.

## Anatomy

Form controls allow users to provide data. At a minimum, they include an input and label. They may also include a caption and required field indicator. 

To learn more about anatomy, input methods, forms structure, validation, and more, please refer to our [Forms guidance](/ui-patterns/forms).
