## Usage

Use form controls when requiring data input from the user. For example, creating a new repo configuring settings, and logging in.

This component is a helper component to keep layouts consistent and ensure the correct ARIA attributes are set. You can find some of Primer's form components listed in the [Related links](#related-links) section.

## Anatomy

Form controls allow users to provide data. At a minimum, they include an input and label. They may also include a caption and required field indicator.
