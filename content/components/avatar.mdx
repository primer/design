## Usage

Use avatars to represent users, organizations, bots, or teams. On GitHub, avatars are either rounded squares or circles. 

## Options

### Size

Avatars start at 16px and increment by base-4 until 32px. At 32px, the scale switches to base-8 up to 48px.
64px is the largest size in this scale.

Avatars appear as two different shapes, each with their own functional purpose.
- **Circle avatars** represent individual people. 
- **Square avatars** represent non-human entities, such as bots, teams, or organizations
