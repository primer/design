## Usage

Counters can be added in appropriate scenarios to provide context. For example, showing social proof by displaying the number of people watching a repo.

## Options

#### Counter attached to a button

A count can be displayed as a separate element that is attached to a button. Only display a count as separate element that is attached to a button when the button uses the "small" size variant and the button type is "Default" or "Outline".

#### Counter inside of a button

For a counter that can be displayed inside of a button, see the [counter label](/counter-label) component.
