## Usage

The box component is considered a utility component, as it can be used for something as simple as a rounded corner box.

By default there are no additional styles, as these can be achieved using styled system props to enable custom theme-aware styling.

## Accessibility and usability expectations

The component provides no semantic information. It's only function is to provide a container for other content.

### Implementation requirements

None. The component is a simple div. No semantic information is provided by the component and therefore additional markup will be needed to provide semantic information if required.

### Known accessibility issues (GitHub staff only)

 <AccessibilityLink label="Box"/>
