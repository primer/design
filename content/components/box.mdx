## Usage

The box component is considered a utility component, as it can be used for something as simple as a rounded corner box. 

It's comprised of a container with a white background, a light gray border, and rounded corners. By default there are no additional styles, as these can be achieved using styled system props to enable custom theme-aware styling.
