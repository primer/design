## Usage

Use this component to represent a branch name label and link to its tree.

## Options

### Icon

Include the branch icon when using the component in isolation and in places where users can’t easily determine whether the label represents a branch from the surrounding context.

## As a link

Branch name is rendered as a link by default. You can also represent the branch label in plain text.
