# Component documentation MVP guides

## Description
One of the strategies to help Primer documentation become self-serve is to accurately represent the breadth of patterns and components we have available through our documentation. 

To do this, we are increasing our coverage to include 100% of available-for-use components temporarily in the primer/design repository. Executing on this plan requires us to be practical and concise in terms of the depth of the documentation. In order to ensure we can reach 100% coverage, we're using an MVP approach. 

## Principles for this approach 
- Accurate
- Informative but concise
- Visible

## MVP documentation approach
Aside from components we deem to be high touch and therefore requiring more in-depth documentation ([listed here](#)), the majoritk of components that are missing usage guidelines will be documented with the following minimum requirements:

Description
- brief text describing what the component is
- release + accessibility status
- link to available implementations
- visual, if applicable 

Usage
- proper usage guides
- visual examples

## Add more documentation if it's readily available
If more information (than required above) is easily accessible and doesn't require a huge time investment to include, it should be added to to MVP documentation. Some examples of this include listing out related components, cross-linking to Accessibility guidelines, and more. 

Take a look at the Component documentation guides for an full overview of content recommendations and how to write them.

## Docs hacking and writing sessions
Let's spend two days tackling this as a team to ensure we can reach our coverage goals. 

### Format & team structure
- Teams of 3
- Choose 6 components to tackle as a team (of 3)
- Each team member to document 1-2 components using the model above, as well as the Component documentation guidelines
- Each team member is expected to review the others' documentation before merging
- Create a new component documentation .mdx file in /design/content/components. Copy and paste [this mdx template](#) into your file as a starting off point.

### Timeline
- 2 days dedicated to writing

### Tips and tricks
- Timebox each component to x hour(s) for writing, x hour(s) for reviewing, and x hour(s) for writing revisions.
- If you get stuck or a component clearly needs more thorough documentation in order to be accurate, swap it out for another component and add it to the task list for deeper documentation models. 
- A great starting off point is to consolidate existing documentation for the component that's already available. Places to look
  - Figma (Primer Web file of components)
  - primer/css
  - primer/react
  - primer/view-components
  - primer/design/components
  - primer/design/ui-patterns
  - primer/design/accessibility-guidelines
  - related components that may have guidelines applicable to your component 
- If your team has questions about a specific component and its correct usage, reach out to the #xyz Slack channel. @xyz and @xyz are this sessions dedicated "FR's" and are solely around to help field component usage questions.
