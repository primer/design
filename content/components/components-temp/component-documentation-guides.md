# Component documentation guidelines


## Documentation principles
Primer documentation should express the voices and contributions of different people, but for it to be useful itâ€™s important to be consistent in tone and structure. 

### Concise but friendly
A large proportion of readers want to find an answer that helps them complete a task, so don't waste their time 

### Universally understood
Avoid using phrases or referencing examples that are only familiar internally at GitHub. Assume readers are either members of the public or new to GitHub. 

### Production quality
Code examples should promote what we'd like to see used in production. While examples might be simpler than what we'd use in production, the code should promote best practices and follow our principles and accessibility standards.

Consider the core elements needed to properly document a component and its usage within Primer UI. 


## Documenting components
When documenting components, consider the core elements needed to convey its main purpose and proper usage within the UI.

### Types of components 
#### Regular
- Standard components used to build Primer UI
- Example:  [ActionList](#)

#### Internal
- Components used by other components that do not exist on their own. 
- Example:  [Overlay](#)

#### Behavioral
- Components with no real anatomy or structure, rather behaviors
- Example:  [Truncate](#)

### Component documentation structure
#### Description
- What is this component, and how would you describe it to someone who has never used it before? This description should be as concise and shouldn't include usage information, which is covered below this section. 
- Release status
- Accessibility status

#### Usage (Overview)
- When to use
- Best practices
- Do/Don't examples
- [Usage documentation example](#)

#### Options
- Different sizes, typography options, layout variations, spac
ing, etc
- Different applications of the component in context
- [Options documentation example](#)

#### Anatomy 
- Describe the elements that make up the component, including typography, spacing, and styles. This can also include sub components, if there are any
- [Anatomy documentation example](#)

#### Interactions
- If there are specific behaviors or interactions that the consumer of this documentation should be aware of, it's important to document that. Is it clickable or static, does it have any specific interactions based on state? Are there multiple types of behavior, and when does each get applied?

#### Accessibility
- Usage
- Keyboard navigation
- Touch targets
- Any specific usage guidelines with regards to assistive technology
