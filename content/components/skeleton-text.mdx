## Usage

Skeleton text may be used to improve perceived performance by rendering a rough representation of text content that is still loading.

However, it is important to avoid using skeleton text to replace interactive elements that are still loading. Instead, hide interactive elements that are still loading until they are ready to be displayed.

## Options

### Sizes

  display="flex"
  alignItems="flex-start"

Skeleton text sizes are designed to match the font sizes and line heights defined in Primer. See [typographhy docs](/foundations/typography) and [Primitives Primitives](https://primer.style/primitives/storybook/?path=/story/typography-functional--display) for details.
