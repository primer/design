## Usage

A skeleton box can be any size or shape, and may be used to render a skeleton loader to replace content that cannot accurately be replaced by a skeleton avatar or skeleton text component.

For example, you may want to render a skeleton loader in place of a hero image in a content card that is still loading.

## Options

You may customize the `width` and `height` dimensions of the skeleton box to match the size and shape of the content it is replacing.

## Acccessibility

Refer to the loading pattern [accessibility guidelines](/ui-patterns/loading#accessibility). Specifically, the secion about [avoiding over-announcing loading states](/ui-patterns/loading#avoiding-over-announcing-loading-states).
