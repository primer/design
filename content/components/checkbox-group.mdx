## Usage

Use checkbox group to allow users to select multiple items from a list of individual items, or to mark one individual item as selected.

### Best practices

- Put checkboxes in a logical order
- If users are only allowed to select a single option, consider using a [radio group](/components/radio-group) instead
- Each checkbox's state should be independent from other checkboxes in the group. For example: checking one checkbox should not check or disable any other checkboxes

**Label:** A title that labels the group of options and helps users understand the relationship between the options in the group.

**Required indicator:** Indicates that a selection is required.

**Caption:** May be used to provide additional context about the checkbox group when the label alone is not sufficient

**Options:** A list of options represented using [checkboxes](/components/checkbox).

**Validation message:** A message explaining why the selection failed validation. See the [form pattern documentation](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#validation) for more information on form validation patterns.

## Accessibility

Once a user checks an option from a checkbox group, the result should not be saved or applied until the user has explicitly submitted their input using a "save" or "submit" button. See the [saving pattern guidelines](../ui-patterns/saving) for more information.
Alternative: you can use a [toggle switch](/components/toggle-switch) to immediately toggle something on and off as long as it's not in the context of a bigger form that applies other input values when submited
