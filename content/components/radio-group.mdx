## Usage

Use radio group to allow users to select a single option from a short list of related options.

### Orientation

A vertical orientation makes options easier to visually scan. A horizontal orientation is not yet supported.

**Label:** A title that labels the group of options and helps users understand the relationship between the options in the group

**Required indicator:** Indicates that a selection is required

**Caption:** May be used to provide additional context about the radio group when the label alone is not sufficient

**Options:** A list of mutually exclusive options represented using [radio buttons](/components/radio)

**Validation message:** A message explaining why the selection failed validation. See the [form pattern documentation](../ui-patterns/forms/overview#validation) for more information on form validation patterns.

### Best practices

- Put radio buttons in a logical order
- Only use a radio group for a short list of options: aim for 6 or less options. For longer sets of options, consider using a `<select>` input <!-- TODO: update "`<select>` input" with a link to the Select component doc once it's created -->, an [action menu](/components/action-menu), or an [autocomplete input](/components/autocomplete).
- Radio buttons cannot be unchecked, so only use a radio group when a selection is required. Consider the following alternatives:
  - use a radio group, but with one option that equates to "none of these options"
  - use a [checkbox group](/components/checkbox-group) that fails validation if more than one option is selected
- If there is an option that's the most likely option to be checked, that option should be checked by default

## Accessibility

- Once a user checks an option from a radio group, the result should not be saved or applied until the user has explicitly submitted their input using a "save" or "submit" button. A radio group is a single tab stop, and the options can be navigated using the arrow keys: this means assistive technologies like a screen reader cannot "read" an option without selecting it. See the [saving pattern guidelines](../ui-patterns/saving) for more information.
  - Alternative: you can use a [segmented control](/components/segmented-control) to immediately apply the selection as long as it's not in the context of a bigger form that applies other input values when submited
- Radio groups must be labeled. The label may be visually hidden, but visible labels are preferred.
