## Usage

Buttons can be grouped together as individual segments of related actions. 

Each segment in a button group is comprised from our default button component and can be visually represented with the same button types and states.

### Best practices

- Use button groups to organize similar functionality. Don't group buttons just because they're close together

- For most use-cases, only default and outline button types should be used in button groups. In rare cases, primary buttons can be included in button groups but there should only ever be one primary button (if any) in a button group.

- Button groups can also be used as a filtering pattern.

## Options

### Size

Button groups only support medium (default) and small button sizes.

### Split buttons with a dropdown

A button group can be shown as a split button with an action on the left and dropdown button with an additional list of actions.

### Leading and trailing visuals

Similarly to buttons, button segments can optionally include an icon and/or a counter.

## Accessibility

### Descriptive buttons

Labeling buttons properly lets users know what will happen when they activate the control, lessens errors, and increases confidence.
