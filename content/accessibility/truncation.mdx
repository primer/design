title: Truncation
---

## Overview

Truncation means shortening a text when it reaches a larger length than required, usually shorten with ellipses.

There are several parts of our platform where we will have some text, which can probably contain focusable elements like links,
and we won't have enough space to show it completely, so we wan't to truncate it. How do we truncate it in the most accessible way?

The answer is unfortunately that we need to be a lot more explicit about how that truncation happens.
We would need to identify a couple of use cases to understand the way that truncation can be done.

## Implicit vs Explicit truncation

### Implicit truncation

Implicit truncation means that a certain text is truncated and the user has to take an action to make the text appear in full, although that action is not an explicit action using a control in the interface, meaning that the user can only expand by hovering or focusing it.

### Explicit truncation

Explicit truncation means that a certain text is truncated and it includes an actual control in the interface that can be clicked on or pressed with the keyboard,
letting the user expand what is displayed.

## General Rules

### Focusable elements

As a general rule we should not use implicit truncation text that can contain focusable elements.

Some of the potential issues are:
- the focusable elements could be completely hidden and they will randomly appear when the user navigates into them.
- the focus seems to disappear.
- focusable elements can be truncated in the middle.
- "unsecure" links can be focused via keyboard whith no visual focus.

### Security

We don't want to ever truncate something that causes any potential security concerns.
For example, truncating a URL is a security bad practice, because the user doesn't have insight into where the link might be going.

### Untrue information

In some situations we don't control in which part of the text the truncation is happening, so we wan't to avoid to truncate a text if that could be considered as 
"untrue information.
Ideally never truncate in the middle of a word, and even more ideally never truncate in the middle of a sentence or paragraph.

For example, if a text include mentions, truncation can happend at the middle of one, confusing the user who's reading the text.
Or we truncate the name of a company, and we don't control where the truncation is happening, it might be that several companies with the similar beginning at their name have the same visual truncation, and that would be very confusing for the user.

## Truncation options

### CSS Truncation

CSS provides mechanisms allowing you to visually hide or truncate content without needing to touch the underlying HTML. Many of them thus will not affect screen reader users' experience at all.

- `text-overflow: ellipsis` (combined with `overflow: hidden` and `white-space: nowrap`): This combination of attributes allows for easy visual truncation of long text which might overflow outside its container.
However, since the text which doesn't fit never actually gets removed from the DOM, screen reader users will hear the entire thing when they navigate to it.

Truncation can be achieve applying the [Primer CSS class for truncation](https://primer.style/css/components/truncate) to the text element,
so when a text reaches lengths larger than existing container, it shortens with ellipses.

### Progressive disclosure

[Progressive disclosure](https://primer.style/design/ui-patterns/progressive-disclosure) is an interaction design pattern that hides/shows information.

### Using a tooltip
