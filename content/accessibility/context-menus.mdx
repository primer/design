title: Context menus
---

## Overview

A context menu is a menu of options on a web page or application that appears when you right click, press a key combination (Shift+F10 for Windows, VO+Shift+M for macOS with VoiceOver running), or press the context menu key on a keyboard. By default, on a website it gives the user a list of options applicable to the browser, such as: Back, Reload, Save As, Print, etc. There are occasions in web apps where it may be necessary to override the default browser context menu with a custom context menu.

## Why replace the browser context menu?

Some web apps have complex functionality and having a custom context menu would help surface common options for a particular element. An example would be a spreadsheet application. Each cell may have multiple actions that could be taken, such as: Cut, Copy, Paste, Insert row, Delete row, etc. These actions may also have keyboard shortcuts associated with them, so having them in a menu will help a user understand what they are.

## Guidelines

All [semantics and functionality for accessible menus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menu/) (for designers and engineers) apply to custom context menus.

### For designers

1. Unless there is a good use case (such as the spreadsheet use case previously mentioned), users may not be expecting the default context menu to be overwritten. Proceed with caution.
2. This should not just be a keyboard feature. There should be some indication to users that the context menu exists. Some examples:

   - A visual icon
   - A tooltip or popup that appears for first-time users

3. If there are global keyboard shortcuts associated with a menu item, they should appear visually on the menu item.
4. Context menus should be consistent throughout the application. For example, if one spreadsheet cell has a context menu, they all should.

### For engineers

1. The menu element should have `aria-label="Context"`. This is what users will expect.
2. The [contextMenu event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/contextmenu_event) is triggered by either right clicking or pressing the context menu key. This event can be used to replace the default context menu with a custom menu.
