title: Text resize and respacing
---

## Overview

Users should be able to resize text and use custom text spacing without text being clipped, truncated, or obscured. In addition, interactive controls should not
break.

## Why?

People with low-vision may rely on the browser's zoom functionality or update the font-size of a page to read content. Additionally, people with low-vision
and people with dyslexia may increase text spacing with custom CSS to improve readability. 

When sites are built without adequate considerations around responsiveness (for example: setting fixed width and height, using non-relative font sizing), sites may become completely unreadable 
and unusable for some users.

## How to test 

### Text resizing

Most modern browsers support full-page zoom, while some also support text-only zoom (for example: Firefox). While WCAG does not specify how text should be resized, it is best practice for your 
page to be readable with full-page zoom and text-only zoom. Aside from using the browser zoom, some users may also resize text through browser font-size setting.

Test your page by using browser zoom with magnification of up to 200%. Confirm that the text content does not overflow, overlap, or become truncated, and that interactive controls still work.

### Text spacing

Modify text spacing according to the [WCAG text spacing testing guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html). You can do this
by changing the CSS using the browser inspector or by using a tool like [Steve Faulkner: text spacing bookmarklet](https://cdpn.io/stevef/debug/YLMqbo).

Confirm that text is contained within the bounds of its container without overlapping or being cutoff.

## Guidelines

### For designers

When creating a design, ensure that font sizes and element sizes are annotated with proper resizing techniques before handing it off to an engineer. There are a variety of techniques that 
can be employed to ensure responsive text and space resizing. This includes avoiding setting fixed height on a container to allow text content to expand, and using relative units such as `em` and `rem` instead of `px`.

Learn more about the techniques at: [WCAG Resize text techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html#techniques) and [WCAG Text spacing techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html#techniques).

### For engineers

As you're developing a feature, make sure to test the page using the resize techniques described in [How to test](#how-to-test). Ensure that [WCAG Resize text techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html#techniques) and 
[WCAG Text spacing techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html#techniques) are employed.
