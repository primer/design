title: Tooltip alternatives
---

## Overview

Tooltips are often used to convey information. However, tooltips are rarely appropriate, and its misuse can result in a myriad of accessibility issues.
Always consider **not** using a tooltip for an improved user experience.

## Why?

- Tooltips are hidden by default making it easy to miss, so they should never be used to convey critical information.
- Tooltips are never accessible on mobile devices.
- Tooltips should **never** be set on static elements (for example, `div`, `span`, `p`), and should only ever be set on interactive elements (for example, `button`, `a`). Tooltips on static elements are not accessible to keyboard users and screen reader users.

## Guidelines 

### For designers

Only include tooltips on your design as a last resort. Never include tooltips on static elements. 

If you have an appropriate tooltip in your design, be sure to annotate the tooltip carefully with the preferred type (for example, label or description) to ensure proper semantics.

### For developers

If you come across a design or a page with a tooltip on a static element (for example, `div`, `span`, `p`), remove it. Consult a designer for an alternative way of conveying the information.

If you determine that tooltips are appropriate for your use case, make sure to carefully follow guidelines set in [PVC: Tooltip component](https://primer.style/view-components/components/alpha/tooltip).

## What are alternatives to tooltips?

### 1. Always persist the content

If possible, persist the content so it's available rather than using a tooltip which hides content by default. This ensures that the content is always discovered and surfaced to consumers regardless of device.

### 2. Don't show content

If the tooltips duplicate content that is already available on the page, remove it.

### 3. Use a modal

Consider using a modal which will be accessible for mobile users and will allow you to structure content which may otherwise be crammed into a tooltip.

       <Caption>Do use a pattern that is accessible for more groups of users such as a modal</Caption>

    </Do>
    <Dont>
       <Caption>Don't set tooltips on static elements nor set long content inside a tooltip</Caption>

### 4. Use a summary disclosure

Consider using a summary disclosure which will be accessible for mobile users and offers ability to show or hide content similar to a tooltip.

       <Caption>Do use a pattern that is accessible to a larger number users such as a summary disclosure</Caption>

    </Do>
    <Dont>
       <Caption>Don't set tooltips on static elements nor set long content inside a tooltip</Caption>
       <img width="800" alt="Screenshot of GitHub pricing page that initially used a tooltip to hide and show long descriptions for each point made" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16447748/159561347-1c2c9d38-7082-44f7-b9d8-642c8cca8085.png" />
