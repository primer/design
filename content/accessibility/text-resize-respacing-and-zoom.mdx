title: Text size, spacing, and zoom
---

## Overview

Users should be able to resize text and use custom text spacing without text being clipped, truncated, or obscured. In addition, interactive controls should not
break.

## Why?

People with low-vision may rely on the browser's zoom functionality or update the font-size of a page to read content. Additionally, people with low-vision
and people with dyslexia may increase text spacing with custom CSS to improve readability. 

When sites are built without adequate responsivity considerations (e.g. setting fixed width and height, using non-relative font sizing), sites may become completely unreadable 
and unusable for some users.

## How to test 

### Text resizing

Most modern browsers support full-page zoom, while some (e.g. FireFox) also support text-only zoom. While WCAG does not specify how text should be resized, it is best practice for your 
page to be readable with full-page zoom and text-only zoom. Aside from using the browser zoom, some users may also resize text through browser font-size setting.

Test your page by using browser zoom with magniciation of up to 200%. Observe that the text content does not overflow, overlap, or become truncated, and that interactive controls still work.

#### Text spacing

Modify text spacing according to the [WCAG text spacing testing guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html). You can do this
by changing the CSS using the browser inspector or by using a tool like [Steve Faulkner: text spacing bookmarklet](https://cdpn.io/stevef/debug/YLMqbo).

Observe that text is contained within the bounds of it's container without overlapping or being cutoff.

## Guidelines

### For designers

When creating a design, ensure that font sizes and element sizes are annotated with proper resizing techniques before handing it off to an engineer. There are a variety of techniques that 
can be employed to ensure responsive text and space resizing. This includes avoiding setting fixed height on a container to allow text content to expand, and using relative units such as `em` and `rem` instead of `px`.

Learn more about the techniques at: [WCAG Resize text techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html#techniques) and [WCAG Text spacing techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html#techniques).

### For engineers

As you're developing a feature, make sure to test the page using the resize techniques described in (How to test)[#how-to-test]. Ensure that [WCAG Resize text techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html#techniques) and 
[WCAG Text spacing techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html#techniques) are employed.
