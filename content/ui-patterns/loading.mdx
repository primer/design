## Overview

Performance is a priority at GitHub, and the first approach is to improve the speed of our processes. However, there are times when we can't avoid making users wait. In these cases, maintaining [visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/) through loading states can help users feel stable and in control.

Without indicating that something is loading, users may thing a process has silently failed. This can lead to confusion and frustration.

Some of our components already have loading states built in. Rely on component-specific patterns before designing your own loading experiences.

For example:

- [Data table](https://primer.style/react/storybook/?path=/story/components-datatable-features--with-loading)
- [Select panel](/components/selectpanel#loading)
- [Tree view](/components/tree-view#asynchronously-loading-child-nodes)

## Loading indicators

Loading indicators reassure users that their request is actively being executed, and can sometimes be used to set an expectation for how long they'll be waiting. They may even reduce the users' perception of time.

Animation in loading indicators helps reassure the user that the process is active and the system isn't frozen. However, animation can become distracting or overwhelming. Loading indicators' animation should be subtle, and we should avoid letting a page get overtaken by too many of them.

### Determinate loading indicators

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{alignItems: 'flex-start', gap: 3}}>

<Box flex={1}>

Determinate loading indicators may be used when the progress or duration of a process is known or can be estimated. This type of loading gives the user an idea of how much longer they'll have to wait.

Determinate loading indicators work best for processes that are likely to take longer (approximately 3 or more seconds). Shorter waiting times don't give the user enough time to process the information conveyed by a determinate loading indicator.

</Box>

### Indeterminate loading indicators

Indeterminate loading indicators may be used when the progress or duration of a process is variable or unknown.

This type of loading gives the user a sense that something is happening, but not how long it will take.

#### Spinner

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{gap: 3}}>

A [spinner](/ui-packages/spinner) is the most versatile indeterminate loading indicator. It may be used in place of content that is loading, or adjacent to a loading message

<img width="456" alt="PR status checks being replaced by a spinner" src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/4f4e897e-bbda-4cbc-bd0f-962450c6b5b6" />
</Box>

#### Content skeleton

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{gap: 3}}>

<Box flex={1}>

For large areas of loading content, the loading content may be replaced by a vague representation of the content. This shows users the general shape of the page and could make them perceive the real content as loading faster.

Skeleton loaders may be used when we can approximate the visual shape the loaded content will create on the page. It would feel weird if we showed a content skeleton and then the loaded content looks drastically different.

The [tree view](/components/tree-view) and [data table](/components/data-table) components have these states implemented.

<CustomVideoPlayer

/>
</Box>

#### Loading text

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{gap: 3}}>

<Box flex={1}>

A text-based loading indicator may be used to replace inline elements such as a submit button. Loading text may be accompanied by a spinner or some other animation to convey that the process is active.

</Box>

<CustomVideoPlayer

  autoplay

/>
</Box>

#### Animated icon or illustration

_TODO: reconsider if we really want to endorse this by mentioning it in Primer docs_

<Box display="flex" flexDirection={['column', 'column', 'column', 'column', 'row']} sx={{gap: 3}}>

<Box flex={1}>
  An animated icon or illustration may be used as a "branding moment" for special loading states. This should be used
  sparingly.
</Box>

<CustomVideoPlayer

  autoplay
  src="https://github.com/primer/react/assets/2313998/d5a49e2d-315c-4d55-b929-ef2e6a648712"
/>
</Box>

## Adapting to different wait times

_TODO: consider defining a general network speed to consider when estimating how long something will take to load_

The following is meant as a general guidance. Sometimes we can't even give a rough estimate how long a process will take due to unknown variables such as network speed, device performance, and server load.

<img
  width="960"
  alt="3 images: 1. crossed out loader; 2. spinner; 3. progress bar with text;"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/7b42b9aa-c517-4620-833a-d12b7e6084bd"
/>

Less than 1 second: Don't show a loading state. Seeing a loading indicator flash on the screen could be distracting and make the product feel slower than it is.
1–3 seconds: Use an indeterminate loading state. The user won't have enough time to process the information in a determinate loading state, and potentially cause frustration or confusion about missing information.
3–10 seconds: Use a determinate loading state if possible to keep the user informed about why they're waiting so long.
More than 10 seconds: Use a determinate loading state and avoid blocking other interactions by treating the process as a background task if possible. This reduces the interruption caused by a lengthy process, and could make wait times feel shorter if a user can shift their focus to other tasks. For example, the user can still interact with a pull request while they're waiting for CI actions to run.
_TODO: try and give more details about ways to keep users engaged for 10+ second waits_
_TODO: consider strategies for setting the expectation that a process will take a long time before the user initiates something likely to have a 10+ second wait_

## Lifecycle of a loading state

<img
  width="960"
  alt="4 images: 1. explicitly excluded loading indicator; 2. button in loading state; 3. success banner; 4. error banner"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/10847c35-4af6-4299-84b9-8955841d94ee"
/>

- **Process initiated:** The moment just before loading begins. Usually initiated by a user action such as clicking a button or submitting a form
- **Process in progress:** The process is underway. This is the actual loading state.
- **Process complete:** The process has finished successfully, and the user can continue with their task. If the user isn't navigated to a new context when the task has completed, this step may include some indication of success, such as a green checkmark or a success message.
- **Process failed:** There was an error, and the process could not be completed. This step should include an error message that explains what went wrong and what the user's next time may be. For example, if the user can retry the process, include a button to do so.

## Incremental loading

Whenever possible, show each item in a collection as soon as it loads. Don't wait for every item in the collection to load before showing the items.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <CustomVideoPlayer
      width="456"
      loop
      src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/6e7f87df-0d3e-4a58-a001-dd09e4510cc3"
    />
    <Caption>Show content as soon as it's loaded.</Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <CustomVideoPlayer
      width="456"
      loop
      src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/a06a4ee2-cbe6-4ec0-8551-16381c7bee49"
    />
    <Caption>Don't wait for all content in a collection to be loaded before showing it.</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Whenever possible, prioritize the most important pieces of data to load first. This shows the user the most important content first and gives them a chance to interact with things sooner. This could be especially helpful for somebody on a slow network.

<img
  width="960"
  alt="4 images of a repo card from the feed loading: 1. Skeleton; 2. Text; 3. Actions; 4. Images"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/ea5725c7-bec2-43a0-8cd9-43fba1a27a51"
/>

## Scoping loading indicators to page content

A loading indicator should be placed nearest to the content they are standing in for. Avoid creating a jarring layout shift when the loaded content replaces the loading indicator.

Replace loading indicators with loaded content or error feedback as soon as possible to avoid burdening users with unnecessarily long wait times.

### Interstitial loading screen

<CustomVideoPlayer
  width="960"
  loop
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/4f4f19e3-84e6-45d5-9584-2dadaf125e7d"
/>

Some processes navigate you to a new page once they've completed, and use an interstitial loading page as a transition. This should be done sparingly because loading a new page is a bigger interuption than showing a loading indicator in context on the page.

Interstitial loading screens are useful for:

- processes that take a longer time (approximately 3 seconds or more) and result in a significant change such as the creation of a new repo
- blocking the UI to prevent interruptions or changes to data

### Large areas

<img
  width="960"
  alt="3 images: 1. Spinner replacing status check box; 2. Spinner replacing PR/issues sidebar sections; 3. Spinner replacing modal content"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/9347a9a1-088b-4bf0-829a-a38ba1644525"
/>

Position your loading state in the center of the region, but ensure it's still visible within the viewport.

### Small areas

To avoid information overload and visual noise, consider replacing a series of adjacent loading indicators with a single loading indicator.

<DoDontContainer>
  <Do>
    <CustomVideoPlayer
      width="456"
      loop
      src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/eed9b892-39a1-45d4-b22b-5c92a4842c1d"
    />
    <Caption>Reduce the number of loading indicators shown on a page.</Caption>

  <Dont>
    <CustomVideoPlayer

      loop
      src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/2313998/95960988-aab0-4c63-9a4e-441cde558ef4"
    />
    <Caption>Don't show a loading indicator for every piece of loading content on the page.</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

## Navigation items

_TODO: bring content over from degraded-experiences.mdx_

## Accessibility

### Conveying loading indicators

Loading indicators are visual and need to be accessible to assistive technologies. This can be done with a visually hidden text element we associate using `aria-labelledby`, or attributes such as `alt` (on an `img` element) and `title` (on a `svg` element).

You may default to a generic label such as "loading", but try to be specific when possible. For example, when a spinner replaces status checks in a pull request, it could have the label "loading status checks".

### Conveying status

Communicate when a process has been initiated, when it's in progress, and when it has been completed or if it has failed.

There are many cases where it will be obvious that a process has completed or failed. For example, a page load or a new element getting focused.
_TODO: what guidelines can we come up with to help users decide how/if to move focus after loading is completed_

For other cases, the status will need to be manually conveyed to assistive technologies. Use a `role="status"` message or put content in an `aria-live` element that communicates the status of a process.

### Preventing partially loaded content from being announced

If an `aria-live` region of a page is being updated, set `aria-busy="true"` on the live region until the updates are complete. Then, set `aria-busy="false"`. This prevent assistive technologies from announcing updates until the updates are complete.

## Draft notes (not part of the guidelines)

These are just for me while I develop these guidelines

### Updates to support these guidelines

- Allow `ProgressBar` to be animated so users don't get concerned that something might be broken
- Content skeleton component(s)

### Other points to get across:

- Don't show a loading indicator to delay showing an error message. Show the error message immediately if we know the process has failed.
- Prevent users from re-initiating a process since it would restart the process and make the wait time longer, or could result in duplicate submissions(?)
- More info on how to properly use skeleton loaders
  - Don't replace interactive elements like buttons or form controls with skeleton states(?)

### Other things to consider:

- More a11y details
- What if something _starts_ as indeterminate but then we get enough data that it can become determinate?

### Questions for a11y:

- How can we help people decide when to announce the changing status of a process? Process statuses identified so far: initiated, in-progress, completed, failed.
- Can we block a user from re-initiating a process while it's in a loading state?
  - Use-case examples:
    - Blocking the screen with a loading overlay
    - Replace a "Submit" or "Load more" button with a loading message
- What are some ways to indicate that something is loading that don't rely on the user being able to see the UI?
  - Use-case examples:
    - Prepending a loading indicator to a piece of loading content such as a nav item or menu item
- How might we determine where focus should move after a process has completed?
  - Use-case examples: (need to come up with more specific examples)
    - Saving some update
    - Re-running an action
- Should we advise against disabling form inputs after a form has been submitted?
- Can we block the UI while something is loading? If so, what's the best way to handle it?
