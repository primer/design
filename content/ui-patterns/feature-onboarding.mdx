# Onboarding

This is a guide for designing onboarding for the product and does not include what to do for marketing pages, email announcements, social media, etc.

Onboarding is a virtual unboxing experience that helps users get started with an app.

- ✅ Think creatively utilizing different ways to onboard users, such as empty states and off-product avenues.
- ✅ For feature annoucements, prepare a release timeline to call out new features.
- 🚫 Do not leave feature annoucement campaigns running forever.

## Guiding principles
### Proximity and proportion
Onboarding elements should maintain an appropriate proximity to where the feature will live in perpetuity.

Consider the primary job to be done on a page before disrupting the user with a feature callout.  Keep in mind the context, placement, and dominance of an onboarding element. Onboarding UI choices should be proportional to the hierarchy of the feature on the page.

### Set clear campaign limits
Use feature onboarding UI for a limited time, make it clear to the user how they may dismiss the message and return to their original task quickly. Define clear paramaters for why, when, and how often a user may see a onboarding message:

✅ Define triggers
- System tiggers, e.g. a new feature released, a user should not need to dismiss the same annoucement each time they visit a different repository.
- User triggers, e.g. a user visits a specific repository for the first time, if recurring, a user should feel added value each time they see the message.
      
 ✅ Timebox
- Maximum number of days a coordinated campaign will run across all targeted users.
- Maximum number of times a user will see an in-product message until dismissed.
### Avoid traffic collisions
Avoid showing too many alerts at the same time. Collisions are awkward and undesireable. Consider what other alerts, teaching bubbles, or banners may be active on the page before launching your onboarding experience.

### Create efficient sequences
Sequence tasks in a logical way to increase onboarding success. Clearly define when someone has started setup and successfully completed your flow. Treat your feature onboarding as a story or a journey with a:

- Beginning
- Middle 
- End

### Draw attention to your feature
Use teaching bubbles, alert banners, the feature preview tray, or announcement modals to draw attention to your feature.

- ✅ Use empty states or alert banners to call attention to a feature if users will discover your feature in order to start a task
- ✅ Use teaching bubbles or other easily dismissable elements if users will discover your feature while they are completing another task

### Begin a setup flow
Use [empty states](https://primer.style/design/ui-patterns/empty-states), [teaching bubbles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office-ui-fabric-react/iteachingbubbleprops?view=office-ui-fabric-react-latest), or a [CTA on a marketing page](https://github.com/features/actions) on GitHub to begin a setup flow.

### Guide your user through their task
Use a [form](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), [checklist](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), or other UI elements to help users complete their task.

### Celebrate the finish
Use a toast, flash alert, or other message to confirm the user has completed their task. Message should be short and brief.
