title: Button usage
---

These guidelines summarize how GitHub implements buttons across our products. We have standardized buttons documented on [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css/) and [Primer Components](https://primer.style/components), and these docs which serve as the source of truth for development implementation. This article serves to supplement our technical docs with proper guidance on design implementation.

## Types

At GitHub, buttons are a fundamental building block of our products. Most of the time, we use the "Default" button type, but other types of buttons may be used to indicate something special about the button's hierarchy or functionality. The following table catalogues a quick glance at how we use buttons at GitHub:

| Type      | Visual                                                                                                                 | Usage                                                                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default   | ![btn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/130091137-4f65a6cd-a890-434d-8ec7-292417f149af.png)           | The go-to style to render a button                                                      |
| Outline   | ![btn-outline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/130091138-3e548b4a-0f31-45fb-beed-70aaf7c6b4f2.png)   | To downplay a button, for navigation buttons, or for filter buttons                     |
| Primary   | ![btn-primary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129806123-d7001d50-2900-435e-bb6b-f8289de1a415.png)   | To emphasize the highest priority action on a view                                      |
| Danger    | ![btn-danger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/130091133-a48deda5-089a-4e1d-ac6b-a058a5c2497f.png)    | To warn that an action is potentially dangerous or destructive                          |
| Invisible | ![btn-invisible](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129628226-bbb0aae4-8cba-4175-aa0f-33a6213f4f67.png) | A subtle style used for actions that are of lower priority in a view's button hierarchy |

## Text

### Labels

When designing buttons, keep the label as concise as possible. Buttons are to be understood by their type and text. If further clarity is required, consider adding an Octicon or adding a caption.

    <Caption>Don't use all-caps or other text formats</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Captions

In certain scenarios, buttons require supporting text to give the user more context. Use text labels sparingly, as buttons should generally be able to be understood on their own.

## Sizes

| Size      | Usage                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Medium    | The default button size                                                                                                                                          |
| Small     | Decrease button size when space is limited and the action is of lesser significance.                                                                             |
| Large     | Increase button size to bring prominence to buttons that have major impact. Use large buttons sparingly, as layouts should generally have only one large button. |

## Alignments

### Order

When a secondary button is placed in conjunction with a primary button, the primary button should always be placed on the outermost alignment, or on top and extended full-width if stacked.

    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129807268-f6db63e7-c3c8-48e3-844f-a68daa7f52a1.png" />
    <Caption>Follow this principle to align your buttons accordingly</Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129807410-984487b7-4088-4a12-bdac-07e1123b68dc.png" />
    <Caption>Don't ignore this principle and misalign primary buttons</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

### Full-width

In certain scenarios, it may make sense to use full-width buttons that extend to the width of their container. Use this style sparingly, but some appropriate use-cases include:

- Modals with a singular call-to-action
- Responsive behavior of buttons when scaled down

    <Caption>Don't misuse this modifier by extending buttons full-width unnecessarily</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

## Icons

Use [Octicons](https://primer.style/octicons/) in conjunction with buttons to clarify an action if text alone is not enough to explain its functionality.

In some cases, Octicons are used to create an identifiable visual indicator for a common action or paradigm. For example, the repo icon is used next to repo links, the new repo button, and repeated in the new repo flow. This repetition and continuity helps people learn and identify our visual language.

### Icon with label

Most of the time, a button will have an icon and a label for clarity.

![button with label and icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129626583-22dce7ca-611f-42c7-9a51-2ba1551bb5f5.png)

### Icon only

In some cases, an action can be understood without using just an icon. Icon-only buttons can help save space in a cramped area.

Buttons that only use an icon should still have a label that is invisible to sighted users, but accessible to assistive technology (for example: read aloud by a screenreader).

![button with icon but no label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129626586-378e2b7f-7300-4804-93fb-c88f7f22407e.png)

## Counters

Counters can be added in appropriate scenarios to provide context. For example, showing social proof by displaying the number of people watching a repo.

#### Counter inside button

A count can be displayed inside of a button using a [CounterLabel](https://primer.style/react/CounterLabel).

![button with count inside](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129626580-465111c8-9237-4e33-af42-b2e830ea9cc3.png)

#### Counter attached to a button

A count can be displayed as a separate element that is attached to a button. Only display a count as separate element that is attached to a button when the button uses the "small" size variant and the button type is "Default" or "Outline".

![button with count attached](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129626579-a2f17327-1b6e-43b4-8971-5b9a24f96dda.png)

## Dropdown triggers

### Button that toggles a dropdown

When a button is used to toggle a dropdown, it should have a visual cue to help users understand the functionality.

![dropdown button example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129630903-d66a1ec8-51b5-4ed8-9a28-8ef90518b1c0.png)

### Button with action variants

Group a button with a dropdown button in instances where a primary action allows for variants on the primary action. For example, there are different merge strategies a user can choose from when merging a pull request.

![button with action variants example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2313998/129630910-8c21b316-e6d6-4fb9-b7c2-2d21283a4e86.png)

## Groups

Use button groups to organize similar functionality. Only "Default" and "Outline" button types can be used in button groups. This modifier can also be used as a filtering pattern.

    <Caption>Group buttons just because they're close together</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

## Best practices

### Limit primary button usage

Only use one primary button on the page, whenever possible, to indicate its emphasis relative to other actions. Primary buttons have top priority in visual hierarchy, and using too many of them on a single view dilutes their effectiveness.

### Use outline buttons independently

Outline buttons are mainly used for secondary actions such as filtering. Don't use in conjunction or place in close proximity of other button styles
