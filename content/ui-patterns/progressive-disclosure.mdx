title: Progressive disclosure
---

import {Flex, BorderBox} from '@primer/components'

These guidelines summarize how GitHub implements progressive disclosure—an interaction design pattern that hides/shows information—as well as guiding principles, best practices, and implementation support.

## Guiding principles

### Maintain context for users

When designing interfaces that incorporate progressive disclosure, refrain from creating interactions that drastically disorient the user’s initial point of focus.

### Progressive disclosure vs navigation

It's important to understand the difference between progressive disclosure and navigation patterns. Because the two share common elements, it can be confusing when deciding which type to implement.

Please refer to these guidelines as they detail in-use solutions, and outline best practices for implementation. If you need more help, refer to the [support](#support) section of this article for how to get in touch.

### Pair icons with text when possible

Pair progressive disclosure icons with descriptive text to provide context.

### Implement only as necessary

Progressive disclosure should be used sparingly, when it’s necessary to truncate information for the general layout/design.

## Progressive disclosure UI patterns

The following table outlines common progressive disclosure solutions in use at GitHub.

| Component                       | Icon                                                                                                              | Usage                                                          | Notes                                                                                                                             |

### Chevron icon

The chevron icon is used when elements of content are collapsed and can be toggled open. Typically this icon is positioned vertically, and alternates between “up” and “down” states. This icon is quite flexible, and can stand alone, or be paired with text.

<Flex alignItems="center" flexDirection="column" my={5}>
  <BorderBox width={9 / 12}>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52079947-8a9f9580-254b-11e9-9e64-72a2a38f5ebd.png" />
  </BorderBox>

    <Caption>Utilize appropriate text in scenarios to provide clarity</Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52088378-892c9800-2560-11e9-9e36-0e72599da28a.png" />
    <Caption>Don't use the chevron to trigger dropdowns</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

**Caution:**

- The chevron should not be used as a call-to-action for dropdown menus
- It should not be used for pagination, or indicate directional actions

### Fold/Unfold

This icon is used to signify that there is content that can be toggled open and closed. It is typically surrounded by text content above and below it. There are currently versions of this icon that expand the context in a singular direction, but are only used in GitHub’s code review editor.

<Flex alignItems="center" flexDirection="column" my={5}>
  <BorderBox width={9 / 12} border="1px solid" borderColor="gray.3" mb="2">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52096167-c43bc500-257a-11e9-9e20-a0371eb83720.png" />
  </BorderBox>

    <Caption>Use this icon to show content expansion in the code editor</Caption>

    <Caption>Don't pair this icon with lengthy text</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

**Caution:**

- This icon should generally be used to signify the expansion of text content
- Generally this icon is not displayed with accompanying text

### Ellipsis icon

The ellipsis icon is used for toggling truncated inline text content. Its primary purpose is to serve as a method that designers to use to curtail bodies of texts, but sometimes other types of information.

    <Caption>Use this icon to give users the option to toggle the amount of text being displayed</Caption>
  </Do>
  <Dont>
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24916540/52093714-1546bb80-2571-11e9-8799-9260792e40f5.png" />
    <Caption>Don't substitute a Kebab icon in the place of an ellipsis</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

**Caution:**

- While visually similar, the ellipsis icon is different from the kebab icon, which is used for dropdown menus or general call-to-actions. Be careful not to confuse them for one another
- This icon generally stands alone within inline bodies of text

### Iterate and componentize

If or when certain progressive disclosure patterns emerge in your design, or you believe a certain solution should be made into a component, reach out to the [#primer](https://github.slack.com/archives/CSGAVNZ19) channel on Slack to discuss how you can submit your code or idea. You may also reach out by opening an issue to the Design Systems team directly on GitHub.

### Requesting feedback

Progressive disclosure can be tricky to implement, and certain designs and scenarios may test the bounds of our design guidelines. If you have further questions or need clarity on implementation, please get in touch via the [#primer](https://github.slack.com/archives/CSGAVNZ19) channel on Slack.
