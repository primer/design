title: Destructive (danger) sequences

import * as Images from '/images/danger'

When users are making a destructive change to their GitHub account, we need to make sure they have a clear understanding of what is about to happen. Many times these changes are reversible, but may have irreversible side effects (making a repository public). Other times, they're not reversible at all (deleting an organization). Either way, we need to ensure that we've done everything we can to make sure there are no gaps in communication that may cause unintended effects so that we don't lose trust with users.

# Non-critical data

There are several types of data within GitHub that will need to be deleted from time to time. Many of these are non-critical and can be handled with out using a `danger` visual treatment. These non-critical destructive flows include deleting a comment, issue, pull request, or discussion.

# Critical data

For critical destructive flows (including modifying user access, deleting repositories, making private data public, etc.), there are 3 basic treatments we can apply that will ensure the full effects of a change are clear to users and that we minimize loss of trust.

## Visual treatment

1. We should highlight all destructive flows visually. 
  a. All page sections that will trigger a destructive sequences should be highlighted with `border-red` and an `alert` icon to build an accessible, intuitive pattern of recognition. When people see those details, they should know to tread carefully. Ideally, these will be centralized into a `Danger Zone` section.
  b. Any actions that will delete significant user data must use the `btn-danger` class.

2. Any actions that have prerequisites should remain disabled until those prerequisites have been completed.

3. Use standard danger buttons for standard views to avoid drawing unnecessary attention to the danger flows. We want to indicate that they are dangerous, not pull the user's attention away from what they are doing.

## Secondary confirmation

We should force users into a secondary confirmation flow - generally a [box-overlay]() - to ensure that they understand the full impact of the decision.

1. The user should be informed of exactly which data **will** be destroyed and forced to confirm that they understand it. This should be explained clearly and concisely in a bulleted list form, using the [`x` octicon]() to both draw attention and emphasize that it will be deleted. We should not list out data that will *not* be deleted.

2. Each step in the confirmation flow enables the next step. This forces users to work through each step in sequence and adds a layer of friction that is not prohibitive, but should help minimize errors.

3. The user should be informed of the the steps to revert those changes (if reversible) and forced to confirm again.

4. In cases where the data will delete a user account, an organization, or a repository, the user should be forced to enter their password before confirming.

5. On secondary confirmation modals, the button should always be red to indicate its seriousness. It should be disabled by default. It should be enabled when all prior confirmation steps are completed.

_All data deletion should follow the [audit logging rules](https://githubber.com/article/technology/dotcom/audit-logs/adding-new-events) and log all destruction events for the support team to help them handle cases where something has gone wrong._

# Non-destructive danger patterns

There are several cases within GitHub where we treat conversions or feature enablements as `danger` patterns. Examples include converting a pull request to a draft (no data is deleted) and enabling GitHub Pages (no data is deleted, some pages are published). These should not follow the `danger` patterns established above *unless* data is being deleted as those treatments should be specifically reserved for deletions.

In these cases, we want to make sure users are sufficiently informed of what will happen without visually implying that data will be lost. If we are concerned that the user may not have enough context to make a decision, we should use a [`box-row`]() with `bg-yellow` and the `warning` octicon to provide the necessary information. If an action is required, use `btn` or `btn-outline` instead of `btn-danger`.
