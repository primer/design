Creating accessible forms can be challenging. Forms are a common source of accessibility issues, and can hinder someone from successfully completing and submitting a form. This can be true even for people who do not use assistive technologies.

The Primer forms framework is designed to be accessible by default, integrate deeply with Rails, follow web standards, and adhere to Primer's [form interface guidelines](/ui-patterns/forms/overview).

## Example

Forms are defined as Ruby classes...

```ruby
class SignInForm < ApplicationForm
  form do |sign_in_form|
    sign_in_form.text_field(name: :username, label: "Username")
    sign_in_form.text_field(name: :password, label: "Password")
    sign_in_form.submit(label: "Sign in")
  end
end
```

...and rendered like view components.

```erb
<%= primer_form_with(url: "/sign-in") do |f| %>
  <%= render(SignInForm.new(f)) %>
<% end %>
```
