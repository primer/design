Github is a diverse and complex platform. These guidelines aim to provide a set of standards that enables consistent, responsive, and accessible experiences.

## Overview

Humans process visual information by breaking down shapes and colors. The visual processing system parses colors and textures in parallel, while parsing shapes and forms one at a time. For this reason, user interfaces are organized following the person’s writing mode. In languages that use the Latin script, the horizontal flow has a left-to-right direction and vertical flow top-to-bottom.

As a consequence, users have expectations on where to find certain elements on a page. Having a consistent layout allows them to focus on their task, and it gives them a better mental model to navigate around GitHub with ease.

GitHub should be designed to support a variety of device types, and pages should adapt their experiences to meet the needs of the user and their devices.

### Takeways

Layouts at GitHub should be:

**Compact**: Strive for dense user interfaces.

**Responsive**: People can access GitHub from any browser or device. Pages should adapt to smaller screens, and take advantage of space in larger ones.

**Consistent**: Consistent interfaces let people focus on their tasks, improves wayfinding and feature discoverability.

## Page fundamentals

Pages are divided into regions that help users understand the content hierarchy and the relationships between the different elements.

### Global header

The global header is the topmost region of the page. It contains the logo, the main navigation, and the user’s avatar.
